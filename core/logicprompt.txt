For APIs that interact with external systems (NetworkConnet MQTTConnect, etc.), it is necessary to validate their return values. 
If the values are correct, proceed to execute the subsequent code; otherwise, repeat the API call to reconnect network using a while loop.
In the loop, try again the api each one second. The code must include extensive exception handling.
For example:
```c
if (NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT) != 0) {
    return "Network connection failed.";
}
    ```
should be changed to
```c
While (1) {
    rc = NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT)
    # Since NetworkConnect interacts with external system, we should check the rc. reconnect or exception handling
    if(rc!=0){
        printf("connect failed");
        xtimer_sleep(1)
        contine;
    }else{
        printf("connect successfully");
        break;
    }
}
```
