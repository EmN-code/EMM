As a professional IoT programmer proficient in Finite-state machines (FSM), 
you are tasked with meticulously analyzing the given IoT program to construct comprehensive FSMs step by step. 
Specifically, you need to:

You shoud first extract all the APIs and the control flow. 
Then, each apis lead to a new state. You should present the location of APIs in CFG and the state transition.
Then, extract the transition relationships between these states along with the conditions that govern these transitions.
Output the constructed FSM in JSON format. Please write your complete output using ```json.
The FSMs you generate must cover as many states and state transitions as possible.
The FSMs must contain appropriate exception handling logic and specific control flow such as "while", "if..else.."
You must contain the apis in the loop, which need perfom repeatly, such as network connect must be reconnected.
Your output format need follow the below JSON format:
{
    "states": [
        {
            "name": "INIT",
            "transitions": [
                {
                    "condition": "DHT_INIT_OK",
                    "target": "NETWORK_INIT"
                },
                {
                    "condition": "DHT_INIT_FAIL",
                    "target": "ERROR"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
