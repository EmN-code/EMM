RIOT_COAP,"I need to develop RIOT code on an ESP32, which  sends a CoAP request to an COAP server. The program is configured to send CoAP POST requests ""Hello, COAP Cloud"" to the COAP server at IP address ""47.102.103.1"" and port 5683, with the URI path ""/coap/test"". "
RIOT_RTC,"I need to develop RIOT code on an ESP32 to achieve RTC alarms. It sets the date to June 1, 2024, and triggers an alarm after 5 seconds, printing ""Alarm triggered!"" upon activation."
