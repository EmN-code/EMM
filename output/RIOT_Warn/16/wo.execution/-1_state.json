            "prefix: This code reads temperature data from a DHT11 sensor every 5 seconds and toggles an LED based on a temperature threshold using RIOT OS on an ESP32. Here's how the solution is structured:\n\n1. **Include Header Files:** \n   - `stdio.h` for printing the outputs to the console.\n   - `xtimer.h` is used for sleep intervals to manage timing.\n   - `thread.h` is included for potential thread management in timing.\n   - `periph/gpio.h` is used for GPIO operations needed to control the LED.\n   - `dht.h` is included for DHT sensor interface.\n\n2. **Define Constants:** \n   - `DHT_PIN` for the DHT sensor pin.\n   - `LED_PIN` for the LED pin.\n   - `TEMP_THRESHOLD` to specify the temperature at which the LED should turn on.\n   - `SLEEP_INTERVAL` is the interval between two consecutive sensor readings.\n\n3. **Initialize DHT Sensor**: This includes setting up necessary parameters and ensuring the sensor is properly initialized.\n\n4. **Initialize GPIO for LED**: The LED pin is initialized in output mode.\n\n5. **Loop**: The main loop repeatedly reads temperature and humidity values from the sensor:\n   - The temperature is checked against the threshold; if it exceeds, the LED is turned on and a warning message is displayed.\n   - If below threshold, the LED is turned off.\n   - The loop uses `xtimer_sleep` to pause execution for 5 seconds between readings.\n\nThis setup ensures continuous monitoring with indication via a hardware LED. \n block: #include <stdio.h>  // For printf\n#include \"xtimer.h\"  // For timing functions, such as xtimer_sleep\n#include \"thread.h\"  // For threading, but primarily here it's included for any timing related threading mechanism\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"  // For GPIO operations (i.e., controlling the LED)\n#include \"dht.h\"  // For interfacing with the DHT sensor\n\n#define DHT_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 4)  // Pin where DHT sensor is connected\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // Pin where your LED is connected\n#define TEMP_THRESHOLD 30  // Temperature threshold for warning\n#define SLEEP_INTERVAL 5   // Time interval between reads in seconds\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize DHT sensor\ndht_t dev;\nconst dht_params_t params = {\n        .pin = DHT_PIN,\n        .type = DHT11\n    };\n    \n    if (dht_init(&dev, &params) != DHT_OK) {\n        printf(\"Failed to initialize DHT sensor\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize LED pin\ngpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n\n    while (1) {\n        int16_t temp, hum;\n\n        // Read values from DHT11\n        if (dht_read(&dev, &temp, &hum) == DHT_OK) {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d.%d%%\\n\", temp / 10, temp % 10, hum / 10, hum % 10);\n\n            // Check if the temperature exceeds the threshold\n            if ((temp / 10) > TEMP_THRESHOLD) {\n                // Turn on the LED\n                gpio_set(LED_PIN);\n                printf(\"Warning: Temperature exceeds the threshold!
