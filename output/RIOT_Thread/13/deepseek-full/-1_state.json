Message Sent -> Send Another Message -> After 1 Sec -> Running\n  2. Message Received -> Process Message -> Message Processed -> Running\n  3. Main Loop Run -> Toggle LED -> After 2 Sec -> Running\n\n- **ref_FSMs**:\n  1. Thread 1 Start -> Thread 1 Running -> MSG Request Sent -> Wait for Thread 2 Response\n  2. MSG Received -> Process Message -> MSG Processed -> Send Reply to Thread 1\n  3. Thread 2 Running -> MSG Received -> Process Message\n  4. Valid Response Received -> Thread 1 Success -> Exit\n\n#### Differences:\n\n1. **Message Acknowledgment Missing in curr_FSMs**:\n   - In the curr_FSMs pattern, sender and receiver threads continuously send and receive messages without an acknowledgment mechanism. This is indicated by the lack of a state like \"Valid Response Received\" or any transition indicating the sender acknowledges the reception or processing of the message by the receiver.\n\n2. **Response and Feedback Loop**:\n   - ref_FSMs clearly models a feedback loop between sender and receiver for acknowledgment and processing results. There are specific outcomes for valid and invalid responses which are absent in curr_FSMs.\n\n3. **Exit Conditions and Robustness**:\n   - In ref_FSMs, the completion paths for Thread1 (success and failure) lead robustly to an exit, indicating completion or failure handling, which is missing in curr_FSMs. There is no clear termination state or failure handling mechanism for communication mishaps in the current code.\n\n#### Corrective Measures:\n\n1. **Implement Acknowledgment Handling**:\n   - Implement a message acknowledgment by modifying the receiver to send a response back to the sender thread upon a successful message receipt and processing.\n   \n2. **Incorporate Feedback Loops**:\n   - Introduce states in sender thread logic to handle different events based on receiver feedback (e.g., acknowledgment received, timeout, invalid content).\n\n3. **Enhance Robustness with Exit Conditions**:\n   - Define exit conditions for the sender after a certain number of successful message transactions or upon detected faults, allowing for controlled termination or retries.\n   \n4. **Error Handling and State Transitions**:\n   - Include error handling states specifically in curr_FSMs to capture and process exceptions or invalid states during message transactions similar to the error handling seen in ref_FSMs.\n\nThese adjustments will bring the curr_code closer to the robustness and completeness observed in ref_FSMs, aligning the curr_code more closely with the intended operational behaviors."
