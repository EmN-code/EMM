            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: **Pattern Analysis of curr_FSMs and ref_FSMs**\n\n**curr_FSMs Pattern:**\n1. MAIN_IDLE -> THREAD_CREATION ->\n2. LOW_PRIORITY_THREAD_CREATION -> MESSAGE_LOOP ->\n3. MESSAGE_LOOP -> MESSAGE_PROCESSING_HIGH / MESSAGE_PROCESSING_LOW -> MESSAGE_LOOP\n\n**ref_FSMs Patterns:**\n1. INIT (UART_INIT_OK) -> THREAD_CREATION -> SENDER_THREAD_RUNNING -> SENDER_WAIT -> NETWORK_RECONNECT\n2. INIT (QUEUE_INIT_OK) -> THREAD_CREATE -> BROKER_CONNECT -> SUBSCRIBE -> PUBLISH_LOOP\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- **Error Handling:**\n  - In the `curr_FSMs`, only thread creation errors transition to `ERROR`, with a single retry condition.\n  - In `ref_FSMs`, there are multiple layers of error handling with different retry conditions like `RETRY_CONNECT`, `RETRY_SUBSCRIBE`.\n\n- **Network and Broker Management:**\n  - The `ref_FSMs` has states handling network reconnection (`NETWORK_RECONNECT`) and broker management (`BROKER_CONNECT`), absent in `curr_FSMs`.\n\n- **Message Processing:**\n  - `curr_FSMs` focuses on a loop between message processing and waiting for new messages.\n  - In `ref_FSMs`, message processing continues in loops until a failure condition or an end condition.\n\n- **Initialization and Resource Management:**\n  - ref_FSMs have an `INIT` state dispersed into initializing UART and Queue components, each potentially failing and transitioning to `ERROR`. This does not exist in `curr_FSMs`.\n\n\n**Incorrect Matching Patterns and Corrective Measures in `curr_code`:**\n\n1. **Lack of Initialization Check: **\n   - Problem: The `curr_code` does not verify the success of the message queue initialization as suggested in the `ref_FSMs` (e.g., UART or QUEUE_INIT).\n   - Correction: Implement checks and state transitions based on success/failures of initialization steps before proceeding to `THREAD_CREATION`.\n\n2. **Error Handling and Robustness: **\n   - Problem: `curr_code` transitions limited errors to an `ERROR` state with only a general `RETRY` condition.\n   - Correction: Implement multiple error handling and recovery mechanisms, including specific error conditions like `NETWORK_RECONNECT` or various resource initializations.\n\n3. **State Transition for Messaging Threads: **\n   - Problem: There's no clear separation in the `curr_code` representing a `RUNNING` and `WAITING` for threads, akin to `SENDER_THREAD_RUNNING` and `SENDER_WAIT`.\n   - Correction: Introduce distinct states in FSM and code to handle different thread statuses such as running and waiting states.\n\nBy implementing robust error handling mechanisms and separating thread states more clearly, the application can become more stable and maintainable."
