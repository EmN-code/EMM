            "prefix: This RIOT code sets up two threads on an ESP32; one acts as a sender and the other as a receiver. The sender thread randomly generates a message and sends it to the receiver thread using the inter-thread message passing system. To achieve this, the code utilizes `msg_t` for encapsulating messages. The receiver thread listens for incoming messages and prints their contents. The system assigns different priorities to the threads to manage execution order. A message queue is initialized to store the received messages, ensuring proper communication between threads. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include \"msg.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n\n#define SENDER_STACKSIZE THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT\n#define RECEIVER_STACKSIZE THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT\n\nchar sender_stack[SENDER_STACKSIZE];\nchar receiver_stack[RECEIVER_STACKSIZE];\n\nmsg_t msg_queue[8];\n\nvoid *receiver_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    (void) arg;\n\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, 8);\n\n    while (1) {\n        msg_receive(&msg);\n        printf(\"Received message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *sender_thread(void *arg) {\n    kernel_pid_t receiver_pid = *(kernel_pid_t *)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        msg.content.value = random_uint32();\n        printf(\"Sending message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        msg_send(&msg, receiver_pid);\n        xtimer_sleep(2);\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    kernel_pid_t receiver_pid;\n    receiver_pid = thread_create(receiver_stack, RECEIVER_STACKSIZE,\n                                THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN + 1, 0, receiver_thread,\n                                NULL, \"receiver\");\n\n    thread_create(sender_stack, SENDER_STACKSIZE,\n                  THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN + 2, 0, sender_thread,\n                  &receiver_pid, \"sender\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
