The high-priority thread and low-priority thread are defined with distinct priorities: `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY`, respectively. The main function initializes these threads and sends a message to them using `msg_send`. The issue encountered previously was due to an incorrect function usage for retrieving thread IDs. Here, we directly store thread IDs during creation using `thread_create`. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define HIGH_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define LOW_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n\nkernel_pid_t high_priority_thread_pid;\nkernel_pid_t low_priority_thread_pid;\n\nvoid *high_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) == 1) {\n            printf(\"High priority thread received message: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        }\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *low_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) == 1) {\n            printf(\"Low priority thread received message: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        }\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    char hp_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n    char lp_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\n    high_priority_thread_pid = thread_create(hp_thread_stack, sizeof(hp_thread_stack),\n                                              HIGH_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n                                              high_priority_thread, NULL, \"hp_thread\");\n\n    low_priority_thread_pid = thread_create(lp_thread_stack, sizeof(lp_thread_stack),\n                                            LOW_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n                                            low_priority_thread, NULL, \"lp_thread\");\n\n    msg_t msg = {.content.value = 42};\n    msg_send(&msg, high_priority_thread_pid);\n    msg_send(&msg, low_priority_thread_pid);\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
