            "prefix: This RIOT application demonstrates inter-thread communication using `msg_t` on an ESP32 platform. We have two threads: a high-priority thread and a low-priority thread. The low-priority thread sends messages containing simulated timestamps to the high-priority thread, which receives and processes these messages. We achieve this using the `msg_t` data structure and `msg_send` and `msg_receive` functions from the RIOT OS API.\n\nWe start by including necessary headers and defining thread priorities. We also define an `INTERVAL` macro to control the timing between messages sent by the low-priority thread.\n\nThe `high_priority_thread` function continuously attempts to receive messages. When a message is received, it prints the value to stdout and simulates work by sleeping for 2 seconds.\n\nThe `low_priority_thread` function sends a message to the high-priority thread every second (controlled by `INTERVAL`). The message content is a simulated timestamp created using `xtimer_usec_from_ticks`.\n\nIn `main`, both threads are created with predefined priorities and stack sizes. The low priority thread periodically sends messages, while the high-priority thread waits to receive them, demonstrating the inter-thread communication. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"msg.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define HIGH_PRIORITY_THREAD_PRIO (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define LOW_PRIORITY_THREAD_PRIO  (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n#define INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC) // 1 second\n\nchar high_priority_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\nchar low_priority_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\nvoid *high_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    (void) arg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) == 1) {\n            printf(\"High priority thread received a message: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(2); // Delay to simulate work\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *low_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void) arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        msg.content.value = xtimer_usec_from_ticks(xtimer_now()); // Simulate sending a message with timestamp\n        msg_send(&msg, thread_get(HIGH_PRIORITY_THREAD_PRIO));\n        printf(\"Low priority thread sent a message\\n\");\n\n        xtimer_sleep(1); // Interval between messages\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    thread_create(high_priority_stack, sizeof(high_priority_stack),\n                  HIGH_PRIORITY_THREAD_PRIO, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n                  high_priority_thread, NULL, \"high_priority_thread\");\n    \n    thread_create(low_priority_stack, sizeof(low_priority_stack),\n                  LOW_PRIORITY_THREAD_PRIO, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n                  low_priority_thread, NULL, \"low_priority_thread\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
