            "prefix: In this solution, we utilize RIOT's threading capabilities to create two threads with different priorities: a high priority and a low priority thread. The high priority thread is designed to receive messages, while the low priority thread sends messages. Inter-thread communication is accomplished using the msg_t message-passing system provided by RIOT. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n1. **Threads Setup**: Two threads are created for message passing. One is given high priority, the other lower priority.\n2. **Message Passing**: The low priority thread sends a message carrying a value to the high priority thread through msg_send(). The high priority thread listens for incoming messages using msg_receive().\n3. **Synchronization**: The low and high priority threads use xtimer_sleep() to simulate work intervals and control message frequency.\n4. **Message Queue**: We use a message queue to hold incoming messages temporarily until they are processed by the high priority thread.\n\nThis approach exploits the RIOT OS's threading and messaging system, providing a robust framework for task prioritization and inter-task communication. \n block: #include <thread.h>\n#include <msg.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN   (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGH   (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_LOW    (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN + 1)\n#define MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE     (8)\n\nstatic kernel_pid_t high_priority_thread_pid;\nstatic kernel_pid_t low_priority_thread_pid;\n\nstatic char high_priority_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\nstatic char low_priority_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\nstatic msg_t msg_queue[MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE];\n\nvoid *high_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    (void)arg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) < 0) {\n            printf(\"High priority thread: Error receiving message\\n\");\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        printf(\"High priority thread received message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *low_priority_thread(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n    (void)arg;\n    msg.content.value = 42; // Example message data\n\n    while (1) {\n        msg_send(&msg, high_priority_thread_pid);\n        printf(\"Low priority thread sent message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        xtimer_sleep(2);\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE);\n\n    high_priority_thread_pid = thread_create(high_priority_thread_stack, sizeof(high_priority_thread_stack),\n                                             THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0, high_priority_thread, NULL, \"high_priority\");\n\n    low_priority_thread_pid = thread_create(low_priority_thread_stack, sizeof(low_priority_thread_stack),\n                                            THREAD_PRIORITY_LOW, 0, low_priority_thread, NULL, \"low_priority\");\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Main thread can perform other operations or remain idle\n        xtimer_sleep(10);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
