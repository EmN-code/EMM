            "prefix: This code sets up two threads in a RIOT environment for the ESP32 platform: a sender thread and a receiver thread. The sender thread sends messages to the receiver using RIOT's messaging interface, specifically the msg_t structure, which is designed for inter-thread communication. The receiver thread initializes a message queue and waits to receive messages from the sender, printing the value of the received message.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n1. **Thread Creation**: Two threads are created with different priorities using RIOT's `thread_create` function. The sender thread is given higher priority than the receiver.\n\n2. **Message Sending**: The sender thread generates a random number using the `random_bytes` function and sends it to the receiver using the `msg_send` function.\n\n3. **Message Receiving**: The receiver thread initializes a message queue using `msg_init_queue` and continuously waits for messages using `msg_receive`. When a message is received, its content is printed.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The code checks for errors in thread creation and message sending, printing relevant messages if failures occur.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Correct format specifiers for printing unsigned long values in printf are used, which resolves errors related to incorrect type usage. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <msg.h>\n#include <random.h>\n#include <thread.h>\n\n#define SENDER_THREAD_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define RECEIVER_THREAD_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE      (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n\nchar sender_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE];\nchar receiver_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE];\n\nstatic kernel_pid_t receiver_pid;\nstatic msg_t msg_queue[8]; // Message queue\n\nvoid *sender(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    while(1) {\n        random_bytes(&msg.content.value, sizeof(msg.content.value));\n        msg.type = 1;\n\n        if (msg_send(&msg, receiver_pid) == 1) {\n            printf(\"Message sent: %lu\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(2);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *receiver(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, 8);\n\n    while (1) {\n        msg_receive(&msg);\n        printf(\"Message received with value: %lu\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    receiver_pid = thread_create(receiver_stack, sizeof(receiver_stack), RECEIVER_THREAD_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, receiver, NULL, \"receiver\");\n\n    if (receiver_pid <= KERNEL_PID_UNDEF) {\n        printf(\"Failed to create receiver thread\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    thread_create(sender_stack, sizeof(sender_stack), SENDER_THREAD_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, sender, NULL, \"sender\");\n\n    // Main thread continues its execution\n    return 0;\n} \n"
