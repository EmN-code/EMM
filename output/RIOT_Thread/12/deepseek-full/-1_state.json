            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: 1. Pattern Extraction:\n\n   **curr_FSMs Pattern:**\n   - Thread initialization -> Sender Thread running -> Message Sent -> Receiver Thread Running -> Message Received -> Receiver Wait.\n   - Network failure leads to a Network Reconnect.\n\n   **ref_FSMs Pattern:**\n   - Thread creation for Sender and Receiver -> Running -> Message Sent -> Process Message.\n   - Main loop should toggle LED after 2 sec.\n\n2. Analysis of Differences:\n\n   - **Thread Creation:** In the `curr_FSMs`, the states don't separate the creation of sender and receiver threads, both happen immediately which can lead to synchronization issues. In `ref_FSMs`, they are handled sequentially and separately (Create_sender -> Create_receiver).\n   \n   - **Network Reconnect State:** In the `curr_FSMs`, the network reconnect logic does not have a corresponding state and transitions in the `ref_FSMs`. Therefore, this could be unnecessary for the current setup or might need adjustments based on actual hardware capabilities and network logic.\n\n   - **Message Processing:** The `curr_FSMs` processes messages as they come in and immediately prints, whereas, in the `ref_FSMs`, it waits for confirmation of message processing before reverting to the running state.\n\n   - **Main Loop Functionality:** In `ref_FSMs`, the main loop alternates with a toggle LED functionality, which is missing in the `curr_FSMs`. This could be for indication of activity which isn't present in the current code.\n\n3. Incorrect Matching Patterns and Corrective Measures:\n\n   - **Thread Separation:** Modify the thread creation to mimic `ref_FSMs` by creating separate states and transitions for initializing the sender and receiver threads sequentially.\n\n   - **Message Processing Confirmation:** Implement logic in the receiver thread that acknowledges the message processing completion before continuing to the next one, as in `ref_FSMs`.\n\n   - **Network State Check:** Evaluate if the network reconnection is necessary in the FSM. If the application doesn't interact with a network, this can be removed. If it's needed, then ensure the logic aligns with `ref_FSMs` network operation or handle it separately.\n\n   - **Adding Main Loop LED Toggle:** Consider adding a toggle LED function to visually indicate an ongoing process during the main loop, as mentioned in `ref_FSMs`. This will aid in debugging and verifying that the main loop is operational."
