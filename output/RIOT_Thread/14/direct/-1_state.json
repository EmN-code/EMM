            "prefix: The task here is to implement a simple RIOT OS application on an ESP32 where a main thread sends messages to two other threads using `msg_t` for inter-thread communication. These threads run with different priorities. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Thread Setup:** Two additional threads are created apart from the main thread, one with high priority and the other with low priority.\n2. **Message Communication:** The main thread sends messages to both the high priority and low priority threads using the `msg_send()` function.\n3. **Thread Functionality:** Each thread has a message handler (implemented via `msg_receive()`) that processes incoming messages and prints out the message content along with its priority.\n4. **RIOT APIs Used: **\n   - `thread_create()` to spawn new threads with specified stack sizes and priorities.\n   - `msg_t` structures to send integer values between threads.\n   - `msg_send()` and `msg_receive()` for inter-thread communication.\n\nThe complete working code demonstrates these concepts. Below is the code implementation, with the necessary header files included in the correct order. \n block: #include <thread.h>\n#include <msg.h>\n#include <event.h>\n\n#define STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define PRIORITY_HIGH (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define PRIORITY_LOW (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN)\n\nstatic char thread_stack_high[STACKSIZE];\nstatic char thread_stack_low[STACKSIZE];\n\nstatic kernel_pid_t pid_high;\nstatic kernel_pid_t pid_low;\n\nvoid *thread_handler_high(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) < 0) {\n            // Handle error\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Process the message\n        printf(\"High priority thread: Received message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread_handler_low(void *arg) {\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (msg_receive(&msg) < 0) {\n            // Handle error\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Process the message\n        printf(\"Low priority thread: Received message with content: %ld\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    msg_t msg;\n\n    /* Start Threads with Different Priorities */\n    pid_high = thread_create(thread_stack_high, sizeof(thread_stack_high), PRIORITY_HIGH, 0,\n                            thread_handler_high, NULL, \"high\");\n\n    pid_low = thread_create(thread_stack_low, sizeof(thread_stack_low), PRIORITY_LOW, 0,\n                           thread_handler_low, NULL, \"low\");\n\n    /* Send Messages to Threads */\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        msg.content.value = i;\n        msg_send(&msg, pid_high);  // Send message to high priority thread\n        printf(\"Main thread: Sent message %d to high priority thread\\n\", i);\n\n        msg.content.value = i + 100;\n        msg_send(&msg, pid_low);   // Send message to low priority thread\n        printf(\"Main thread: Sent message %d to low priority thread\\n\", i + 100);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
