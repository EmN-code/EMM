            "prefix: The task is to create and utilize inter-thread communication using msg_t in RIOT OS on an ESP32 platform. The solution will focus on creating two threads, one acting as a sender and the other as a receiver. Threads will have different priorities, and the sender thread will send messages at regular intervals to the receiver thread.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Initialize the threading environment, set stack sizes, and define priorities.\n2. **Message Queues**: Each thread has its message queue initialized for receiving msg_t type messages.\n3. **Thread Functions**: \n   - **Sender Thread**: It will create a message of type msg_t and send it to the receiver by specifying the receiver's process ID.\n   - **Receiver Thread**: It will block on a message queue waiting for messages and upon receiving, will process the message (indicative processing in this example).\n4. **Thread Creation**: Create the sender and receiver threads with the RIOT OS `thread_create` function.\n\nWe'll need to include the necessary threading and messaging headers provided by RIOT OS. The main function sets up the threads and ensures both are running. Finally, the RIOT application is executed. \n block: #include <thread.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <msg.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN   (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_SENDER  (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_RECEIVER (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n#define MSG_QUEUE_SIZE (8)\n\nstatic char sender_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\nstatic char receiver_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\nmsg_t msg_queue[MSG_QUEUE_SIZE];\nkernel_pid_t receiver_pid;\n\nvoid *sender(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n    msg.content.value = 12345; // example payload\n    while (1) {\n        msg_send(&msg, receiver_pid);\n        printf(\"Sender: Sent message with value %d\\n\", msg.content.value);\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // send every second\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *receiver(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, MSG_QUEUE_SIZE);\n    msg_t msg;\n    while (1) {\n        msg_receive(&msg);\n        printf(\"Receiver: Received message with value %d\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    receiver_pid = thread_create(receiver_thread_stack, sizeof(receiver_thread_stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_RECEIVER, 0, receiver, NULL, \"receiver\");\n    thread_create(sender_thread_stack, sizeof(sender_thread_stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_SENDER, 0, sender, NULL, \"sender\");\n    return 0;\n} \n"
