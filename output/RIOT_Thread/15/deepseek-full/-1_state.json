The nodal error state doesn\u2019t transition directly back but provides room for targeted recovery actions.\n\n### Differences and Incorrect Matching Patterns:\n\n- **Error Recovery**: The `curr_FSMs` provide error transitions that directly loop back to the `INIT` state. The `ref_FSMs` offer more targeted recovery steps, such as conditional reinitialization actions based on specific failure types (like flash erase before retrying).\n\n- **Granularity in Actions**: The `curr_FSMs` lack finer granular checks and state transitions evident in the `ref_FSMs`, like distinguishing between different types of initializations or reads, followed by direct recovery.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n\n1. **Refine Error States**:\n   - Implement more specific transition conditions for error states that reflect different types of initialization failures, much like the targeted error handling procedures seen in the `ref_FSMs`.\n   - E.g., Introduce separate error recovery states and transitions for message queue failures and thread creation failures.\n\n2. **Create Intermediate States**:\n   - Develop intermediate states for certain actions, such as verifying message queue or flash positions before initializing threads or when transitioning back to `INIT`.\n\n3. **Granulated Recovery Strategy**:\n   - Revise the error recovery strategy to encompass different error codes or outcomes, similar to the retries or specific recovery paths in `ref_FSMs`.\n   - Integrate more conditional logic to manage recovery paths before restarting the service."
