            "prefix: The provided code showcases an example of using the RIOT operating system to implement inter-thread communication on an ESP32. The code creates two threads: a sender and a receiver. The sender thread sends a message to the receiver thread using the `msg_t` structure, which is a predefined message type in RIOT for inter-thread communication. The receiver waits for messages and prints the content when it receives one. The code also demonstrates setting up priority and stack size for threads. By making use of the RIOT messaging API, the example efficiently handles message sending and receiving between threads. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"msg.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\n#define SENDER_STACKSIZE   (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n#define RECEIVER_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n\n#define SENDER_PRIO        (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define RECEIVER_PRIO      (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n\nstatic char sender_stack[SENDER_STACKSIZE];\nstatic char receiver_stack[RECEIVER_STACKSIZE];\n\nstatic msg_t msg_queue[8];\n\nvoid *sender_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n    printf(\"Sender: Sending message to receiver\\n\");\n    msg.content.value = 42;  // arbitrary value\n    msg_send(&msg, thread_getpid_of(thread_get(RECEIVER_PRIO)));\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *receiver_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, 8);\n    while (1) {\n        msg_receive(&msg);\n        printf(\"Receiver: Received message with value %lu\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    thread_create(receiver_stack, RECEIVER_STACKSIZE, RECEIVER_PRIO, 0,\n                  receiver_thread, NULL, \"receiver\");\n    thread_create(sender_stack, SENDER_STACKSIZE, SENDER_PRIO, 0,\n                  sender_thread, NULL, \"sender\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
