The sender thread sends a message to the receiver using the `msg_t` structure, which allows for inter-thread communication. The error previously mentioned was due to formatting issues when using `printf`. Specifically, `%d` was incorrectly used for `uint32_t` types, which should use `%u` for unsigned integer representation.
