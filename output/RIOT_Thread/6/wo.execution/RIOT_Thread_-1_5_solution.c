// First, ensure all required dependencies are updated and correctly installed.
// Then, clean the build directory to remove any corrupted or incomplete build files.

# Remove all temporary files from previous builds
make clean-all

# Rebuild the project, ensuring all steps are followed correctly
make flash -j4 BOARD=esp32-wroom-32

// This ensures that all the necessary files are compiled, linked, and the bootloader is properly created.

// Keep in mind that 'flash' command is typically used to both build and flash the application to the board,
// but it will also ensure that the correct process is followed for setting up the elf files.
