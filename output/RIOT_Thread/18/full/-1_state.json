            "prefix: The task here is to develop a program for the RIOT operating system on ESP32 that utilizes inter-thread communication. The program involves setting up two threads (sender and receiver), each with different priorities, and using the message passing mechanism available in RIOT (via `msg_t`) for inter-thread communication. We need to address the errors encountered in the initial code compilation, such as the redefinition and incorrect usage of `THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT` and `msg_t`. Also, ensure best practices like validating the return values in external API calls and using a loop to handle retries with a 1-second delay.
