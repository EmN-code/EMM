# Code Explanation:
The provided code demonstrates creating inter-thread communication using RIOT-OS. It involves two threads with different priorities where one thread sends and the other receives messages. 

The main thread sets up two threads and their respective message queues. These threads wear differentiated by their priority, allowing one to preempt the other depending on its urgency. The sending thread sends messages to the receiving thread by using the `msg_send_receive()` function.

# Imports
The code imports multiple libraries related to messaging, timing, and system operations to support the main functionalities in the RIOT-OS environment.
