### Pattern Analysis:

**curr_FSMs pattern:**
1. INIT -> SETUP_REMOTE ->
   - On success: SEND_REQUEST
   - On failure of CoAP request: RETRY_SEND (with retry mechanism)
     - On success: WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE
     - On failure: HANDLE_ERROR
2. WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE ->
   - On success: PROCESS_RESPONSE
   - On failure: HANDLE_ERROR

**ref_FSMs pattern (extracted from similarities with curr_FSMs):**
1. START -> NETWORK_SETUP ->
   - On success: MQTT_CLIENT_SETUP
   - On failure: HANDLE ERROR
   - Reconnects on specific transition
2. CONNECT_MQTT ->
   - On success: PUBLISH
   - On failure: CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY (with retry mechanism)

### Discrepancies & Corrective Measures:

1. **Error Handling Mechanism:**
   - **Discrepancy:** In curr_FSMs, the retry mechanism from SEND_REQUEST lacks a specific condition for how many times to retry before transitioning to HANDLE_ERROR. This is critical for robustness.
   - **Correction:** Define a max retry count and implement logic to prevent endless retrying. Add a transition that monitors a count and directs to HANDLE_ERROR after a certain number of attempts.

2. **Logical Transition After Failure:**
   - **Discrepancy:** Upon failure in SEND_REQUEST, the curr_FSMs lacks an adequate differentiation between types of errors (recoverable vs. fatal) which may impact the retry mechanism effectively.
   - **Correction:** Implement a decision node within HANDLE_ERROR to classify error types effectively, facilitating more controlled retries vs. transitioning to an error state.

3. **Error State Definition:**
   - **Discrepancy:** The ref_FSMs transition allows a network retry pattern that is absent in curr_FSMs during initialization or setup failures.
   - **Correction:** Consider adding logic similar to NETWORK_SETUP and CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY in ref_FSMs to manage reconnection aspects during the initialization stages in curr_FSMs to enhance robustness when facing initialization issues.

4. **Response Handler Outcomes:**
   - **Discrepancy:** The curr_FSMs does not seem to handle different types of responses from _response_handler function (e.g., unexpected responses).
   - **Correction:** Implement additional branches from the WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE state to handle unexpected or invalid responses appropriately, not just based on success and failure.

Implementing these corrections can align the curr_FSMs more closely with robust mechanisms found in the ref_FSMs, which focus heavily on retry logic and precise failure management.
