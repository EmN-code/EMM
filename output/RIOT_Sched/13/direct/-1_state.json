            "prefix: The following is a code implementation for the ESP32 using RIOT OS, which creates two threads and changes their priorities at runtime. In RIOT, threads can be started with `thread_create` and priorities can be changed with `thread_set_priority`. Here's a step-by-step description of the solution:\n\n1. **Includes and Definitions**: The necessary RIOT header files for threading are included. Two stacks are defined for the threads along with a constant to define the stack size using `THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN`.\n\n2. **Thread Functions**: Two simple thread functions are defined, `thread1_func` and `thread2_func`, each printing its current action and current priority.\n\n3. **main Function**: \n   - The threads are created using `thread_create`, each with an initial priority (thread1 with priority 6 and thread2 with priority 8).\n   - The program sleeps for 5 seconds to allow the threads to run at their initial priorities.\n   - After 5 seconds, the priorities of the threads are switched: thread1 is given a higher priority of 8, and thread2 a lower priority of 6.\n   - The main function enters an indefinite loop allowing the threads to continue executing.\n\nHere is the complete code with the required header files and a complete implementation of the described behavior. \n block: #include <thread.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Define stack size for threads\n#define STACK_SIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n\n// Thread stacks\nchar stack1[STACK_SIZE];\nchar stack2[STACK_SIZE];\n\n// Thread arguments\nstatic const char *thread1_name = \"thread1\";\nstatic const char *thread2_name = \"thread2\";\n\n// Thread function for thread1\nvoid *thread1_func(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 1 started with priority %d \\n\", thread_get_priority(thread_getpid()));\n    while (1) {\n        // Thread 1 performs its task\n        puts(\"Thread 1 is running\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\n// Thread function for thread2\nvoid *thread2_func(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 2 started with priority %d \\n\", thread_get_priority(thread_getpid()));\n    while (1) {\n        // Thread 2 performs its task\n        puts(\"Thread 2 is running\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting threads with initial priorities\\n\");\n\n    // Create thread1 with priority 6\n    thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1), 6, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, thread1_func, (void *)thread1_name, \"thread1\");\n    \n    // Create thread2 with priority 8\n    thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2), 8, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, thread2_func, (void *)thread2_name, \"thread2\");\n\n    xtimer_sleep(5);\n\n    printf(\"Changing priorities of threads\\n\");\n\n    // Change priority of thread1 to 8\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid_from_name(thread1_name), 8);\n\n    // Change priority of thread2 to 6\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid_from_name(thread2_name), 6);\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
