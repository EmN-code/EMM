            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Error Analysis Report\n\n#### Pattern Extraction from curr_FSMs:\n- **INIT:** Creation of threads.\n- **THREADS_RUNNING:** Threads are running for some time.\n- **CHANGE_PRIORITY:** After a delay, the priority of one of the threads is changed.\n\n#### Pattern Extraction from ref_FSMs:\n- **INIT:** Initial setup.\n- **VERIFY_IRQ_STATE:** A verification condition based on various states that leads to success or failure.\n- **SUCCESS_PRINT / FAILURE_PRINT:** Based on verification, prints success or failure and moves to the next step.\n- **VERIFY_TEST_WORKS:** Another verification step with its own success or failure.\n- **TEST_RESULT:** Final verification before ending the process.\n\n#### Differences and Issues:\n1. **Verification and Decision-Making:** The ref_FSMs focuses heavily on conditional verification and making decisions based on state evaluations. This is notably absent in the curr_FSMs which follows a more linear path with no verification.\n2. **Handling State Changes:** In the ref_FSMs, state changes are dictated by checks (such as checking IRQ states, atomic conditions). In the curr_FSMs, the state transition is predominantly time-based (using `xtimer_sleep`) and lacks conditions based on state verification.\n3. **Error Handling:** The ref_FSMs explicitly handle errors with transitions like 'FAILURE_PRINT' and 'ERROR'. The curr_FSMs does not consider any form of failure or error handling during execution.\n\n#### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Introduce Conditional Transitions:** Implement checks and conditions for changing states in `curr_FSMs` like those in `ref_FSMs` (e.g., verify thread states before changing priority).\n2. **Implement Error Handling:** Create transitions that handle potential failures or errors during thread creation or execution. This includes logging or retry mechanisms.\n3. **Evaluate State Before Actions:** Before executing an action such as changing thread priority, ensure the system is in a valid state that permits such an action.\n4. **Follow Safe Practices for Transition:** Using atomic operations or other concurrency mechanisms for shared state access should be considered to prevent race conditions, similar to the atomic checks in the ref_FSMs.\n5. **Dynamic Transitions:** Instead of fixed sleep before transitions, see if events or conditions can be tested to decide transitions dynamically, as seen in ref_FSMs."
