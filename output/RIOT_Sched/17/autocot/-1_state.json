The application will utilize RIOT's threading capabilities, including priority management. We will use the available RIOT APIs for thread management to achieve this functionality. The code will also demonstrate how to print thread stack information, so you can observe if and how the priority changes were executed successfully. \n block: #include \"thread_arch.h\"\n#include \"thread_config.h\"\n\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN    1024\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN     (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_SECOND   (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 3)\n\nchar thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\nvoid *thread_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        thread_stack_print();\n        thread_yield();\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting the RIOT example for thread management...\\n\");\n    \n    kernel_pid_t pid_thread;\n\n    /* Create a new thread */\n    pid_thread = thread_create(thread_stack, sizeof(thread_stack),\n                               THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN, 0,\n                               thread_handler, NULL, \"thread1\");\n    if (pid_thread <= KERNEL_PID_UNDEF) {\n        printf(\"Failed to create thread 1\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    /* Change the priority of the thread at runtime */\n    int res = sched_change_priority(pid_thread, THREAD_PRIORITY_SECOND);\n    if (res < 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to change priority of thread 1\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Successfully changed priority of thread 1\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        /* Main thread work */\n        thread_yield();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
