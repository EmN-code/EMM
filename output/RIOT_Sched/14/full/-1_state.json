            "prefix: Let's develop a RIOT application for the ESP32 that starts two threads and changes their priority at runtime. We'll need to include the specified headers and ensure that interrupts are disabled when changing priorities. Here is a code solution that meets those requirements:\n\n1. **Include the required headers**: These headers provide necessary thread and scheduler functionalities.\n2. **Define thread functions**: We'll create simple tasks that will be executed by the threads.\n3. **Create two threads and initiate them**: We'll use `thread_create` to start two threads with specific stack sizes, priorities, and tasks.\n4. **Change thread priorities at runtime**: Using `sched_change_priority`, we'll alter the priorities of the threads.\n5. **Ensure appropriate header ordering**: The headers are included in descending alphabetical order by their first letter. \n block: #include \"thread_config.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"sched.h\"\n#include \"event/thread.h\"\n\n#define STACKSIZE  (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n\nvoid *thread_func_1(void *arg) {\n    while (1) {\n        // Thread 1 work simulation\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread_func_2(void *arg) {\n    while (1) {\n        // Thread 2 work simulation\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    char stack1[STACKSIZE];\n    char stack2[STACKSIZE];\n    \n    kernel_pid_t thread_pid_1 = thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1), 5, 0,\n                                              thread_func_1, NULL, \"thread_1\");\n\n    kernel_pid_t thread_pid_2 = thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2), 10, 0,\n                                              thread_func_2, NULL, \"thread_2\");\n\n    // Change priorities at runtime\n    irq_disable(); // Disable interrupts before changing priority\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(thread_pid_1), 15);\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(thread_pid_2), 20);\n    irq_enable(); // Re-enable interrupts after priorities are changed\n\n    // Simulate an infinite loop to keep main running\n    while (1) {\n        // Main work simulation\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
