            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Issue\nThe main structural difference between the curr_FSMs and the ref_FSMs lies in their initialization and main operation patterns.\n\n### curr_FSMs Pattern\n1. **MAIN_INIT** - relies on a condition that checks if threads were successfully created (THREADS_CREATED) to transition to the next state.\n2. **Thread Priority Change**: transitions exist to change the priority of threads at fixed intervals.\n\n### ref_FSMs Pattern\n1. **INIT** - transitions occur based primarily on message passing and initialization success.\n2. **Communication with the Threads**: focuses on sending and receiving messages between threads, indicating an inter-thread communication model.\n\n### Differences\n1. **Initialization:** The ref_FSMs has a more robust initialization pattern relying on checks like `msg_init`, making it resilient to initialization failure. In the curr_FSMs, the initialization state directly leads to error or success based only on thread creation.\n   \n2. **Inter-thread Communication:** ref_FSMs suggest a communication model where states rely on message passing between different threads, with specific transitions based on conditions like `msg_received`.\n\n3. **Fixed Transitions on Events:** The curr_FSMs has fixed-duration wait states (like 5-second sleep) to determine transitions, which is less robust as it may not account for real-time execution scenarios like thread load.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n1. **Add Robust Initialization:** Implement a more robust initialization check based on message confirmation as seen in ref_FSMs, to transition from `INIT` to `PERIODIC_EVENT_INIT` only if all systems report successful initialization (`INIT_OK`).\n\n2. **Implement Message Passing:** Integrate a message-passing mechanism between threads to create transitions based on real-time conditions (e.g., `msg_received`), rather than fixed sleeps.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Recovery:** Incorporate error handling and recovery mechanisms as shown in ref_FSMs. Specifically, have a fallback or retry mechanism when thread creation fails.\n\n4. **Real-Time Events:** Replace fixed sleep durations for transitioning with real-time checks or events to enhance robustness and responsiveness, in line with the `PERIODIC_EVENT_START` and `PERIODIC_EVENT_RUNNING` pattern in ref_FSMs."
