            "prefix: This solution demonstrates how to set up and manage two threads on an ESP32 using RIOT OS. Initially, two threads are created: one with higher priority and another with lower priority. After a specified period, the priorities of these threads are swapped to demonstrate dynamic priority management at runtime.\n\n- **Imports**: We include three headers: `<xtimer.h>` for timer functions, `<thread.h>` for handling threading operations, and `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions.\n\n- **Constants**: We define constants for the stack size and initial priorities of the threads. `STACKSIZE` is set to the default value in RIOT, and priorities are set in descending order from the main thread's priority.\n\n- **Thread Handlers**: Two basic thread functions are created. Each prints its status and sleeps briefly to simulate work and yield processor time. `thread_handler_one` runs with higher priority and `thread_handler_two` runs with lower priority initially.\n\n- **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes both threads with their respective priorities. After a delay of 5 seconds, the program swaps their priorities using `thread_set_priority`, reversing their execution precedence.\n\nThis code serves as a basic template to understand threading and dynamic priority adjustments in a real-time OS environment like RIOT on an ESP32. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <thread.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n\n#define STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n#define PRIORITY_MAIN (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define PRIORITY_SECONDARY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n\nchar thread_stack_one[STACKSIZE];\nchar thread_stack_two[STACKSIZE];\n\nvoid *thread_handler_one(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        printf(\"Thread 1 running with high priority\\n\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread_handler_two(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        printf(\"Thread 2 running with low priority\\n\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting threads and changing priority at runtime\\n\");\n    \n    thread_create(thread_stack_one, sizeof(thread_stack_one), PRIORITY_MAIN, 0, thread_handler_one, NULL, \"thread_one\");\n    thread_create(thread_stack_two, sizeof(thread_stack_two), PRIORITY_SECONDARY, 0, thread_handler_two, NULL, \"thread_two\");\n\n    xtimer_sleep(5);\n    \n    printf(\"Changing priorities\\n\");\n    \n    /* Changing the priority of threads dynamically */\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid_by_name(\"thread_one\"), PRIORITY_SECONDARY);\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid_by_name(\"thread_two\"), PRIORITY_MAIN);\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
