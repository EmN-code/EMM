            "prefix: In this solution, we'll set up a RIOT application that creates two threads on an ESP32 platform. These threads will do some basic operations, and at runtime, we will change their priorities. To manage threads in RIOT OS, we'll use functions provided such as `thread_create`, `sched_set_priority`, and `thread_getpid`.\n\nThe ESP32 is a popular platform for IoT applications, and RIOT OS supports thread management, which allows us to make full use of the CPU by scheduling different processes or tasks. This exercise requires the creation of threads and modifying their priorities, demonstrating RIOT's capability to handle multitasking efficiently. Note that we will include the header files in descending alphabetical order, as instructed.\n\nThe code block below defines two threads with a simple function each. After thread creation, we change the priority of one of these threads using `sched_set_priority`. We also ensure to include the necessary header files for RIOT operations and ESP32 configuration. \n block: #include \"thread_arch.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\n// Stack size for the threads\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN   (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n\n// Function to be executed by thread 1\nvoid *thread_1_func(void *arg) {\n    const char *name = (const char *)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        printf(\"Hello from %s!\\n\", name);\n        thread_sleep(); // sleep to simulate doing work\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\n// Function to be executed by thread 2\nvoid *thread_2_func(void *arg) {\n    const char *name = (const char *)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        printf(\"Hello from %s!\\n\", name);\n        thread_sleep(); // sleep to simulate doing work\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    char stack1[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n    char stack2[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n    kernel_pid_t thread1_pid, thread2_pid;\n\n    // Create thread 1\n    thread1_pid = thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1),\n                                THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, 0,\n                                thread_1_func, \"Thread 1\", \"thread_1\");\n\n    // Create thread 2\n    thread2_pid = thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2),\n                                THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2, 0,\n                                thread_2_func, \"Thread 2\", \"thread_2\");\n\n    printf(\"Threads created\\n\");\n\n    // Change priority of thread 1 at runtime\n    sched_set_priority(thread1_pid, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 3);\n    printf(\"Changed priority of Thread 1\\n\");\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Main thread can do additional work or sleep\n        thread_sleep(); // sleep to simulate doing idle work\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
