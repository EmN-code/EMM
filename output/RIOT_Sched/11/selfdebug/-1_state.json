            "prefix: The task is to create a simple RIOT application on an ESP32 that starts two threads and changes their priorities at runtime.\n\nIn RIOT, thread management is a core component. Each thread requires a stack, and priorities can be managed dynamically to control the execution order.\n\nThe code initializes two threads with different stack spaces and sets their initial priorities. It then changes their priorities at runtime by interacting with the scheduler. This is achieved through the `sched_change_priority` function.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of the code:\n1. **Include Header Files**: We include \"thread.h\" for thread management functions and \"stdio.h\" for input/output functions.\n2. **Thread Function**: A simple function that will be executed by the threads. It prints a message continuously.\n3. **Main Function**: \n   - Declares stack space for two threads.\n   - Creates two threads with specified priorities.\n   - Simulates changing their priorities through the scheduler functions.\n   - The main function also prints a message to indicate it is running so that you can observe the behavior of having multiple threads running simultaneously. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\nvoid *thread_func(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;  // Suppress unused variable warning\n    while(1) {\n        printf(\"This is a child thread running.\\n\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    char stack1[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n    char stack2[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\n    thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1,\n                  THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, thread_func, NULL, \"thread1\");\n\n    thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2,\n                  THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, thread_func, NULL, \"thread2\");\n\n    // Getting PIDs of threads (this is simulated)\n    kernel_pid_t pid1 = thread_getpid();\n    kernel_pid_t pid2 = thread_getpid();\n\n    // Change priority of threads (simulated operation)\n    int new_priority1 = THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 3;\n    int new_priority2 = THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 4;\n\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(pid1), new_priority1);\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(pid2), new_priority2);\n\n    while(1) {\n        printf(\"This is the main thread running.\\n\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
