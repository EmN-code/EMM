            "prefix: The errors are occurring because the function `sched_change_priority` is being called with an incorrect argument type. According to the documentation, `sched_change_priority` requires a thread pointer as its first argument, but in the errors mentioned, an integer (likely a process ID) was mistakenly passed instead. To fix this, we need to ensure that we first retrieve the correct thread object corresponding to a given process ID, and then pass that thread object to `sched_change_priority`. We also need to implement the logic to start two threads and change their priorities at runtime. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\n#define THREAD1_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define THREAD2_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define THREAD1_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD2_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n\nstatic char thread1_stack[THREAD1_STACKSIZE];\nstatic char thread2_stack[THREAD2_STACKSIZE];\n\nvoid *thread1_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 1 running\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(2);\n        printf(\"Thread 1 doing work\\n\");\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread2_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 2 running\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(3);\n        printf(\"Thread 2 doing work\\n\");\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    kernel_pid_t pid1, pid2;\n    \n    pid1 = thread_create(thread1_stack, THREAD1_STACKSIZE, THREAD1_PRIORITY,\n                         THREAD_CREATE_WOUT_YIELD, thread1_handler, NULL, \"thread1\");\n    pid2 = thread_create(thread2_stack, THREAD2_STACKSIZE, THREAD2_PRIORITY,\n                         THREAD_CREATE_WOUT_YIELD, thread2_handler, NULL, \"thread2\");\n    \n    /* Simulate some delay before changing priority */\n    xtimer_sleep(5);\n    thread_t *thread1 = thread_get(pid1);\n    thread_t *thread2 = thread_get(pid2);\n    sched_change_priority(thread1, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 3);\n    sched_change_priority(thread2, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 4);\n    \n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n        printf(\"Main thread running\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
