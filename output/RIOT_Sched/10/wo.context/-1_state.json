            "prefix: To solve the error found in the #include directive of your existing RIOT code, we need to make sure the syntax for including header files is correct. The error message suggests there are extra tokens at the end of the #include directive. Ensure there is only one header file specified within each #include directive, and nothing follows the closing angle bracket or closing quote.\n\nHere's the corrected code, structured in the order of including header files in descending alphabetical order:\n\nThis code solution involves running two threads and changing their priorities at runtime on an ESP32 using RIOT OS:\n\n1. Start by defining the thread stack sizes, priorities, and declare functions for the threads.\n2. Inside the main function, create two threads using thread_create, each running a different function.\n3. The created threads will execute their respective functions and can have their priorities changed using sched_change_priority.\n\nThis solution demonstrates handling threads and priorities in a RIOT OS environment, specifically tailored for an ESP32 board. \n block: #include <thread.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY1 (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY2 (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n\nchar stack1[THREAD_STACKSIZE];\nchar stack2[THREAD_STACKSIZE];\n\nvoid *thread_func1(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 1 running with priority change capability.\\n\");\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread_func2(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Thread 2 running with priority change capability.\\n\");\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    kernel_pid_t pid1 = thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1), THREAD_PRIORITY1, 0, thread_func1, NULL, \"thread1\");\n    kernel_pid_t pid2 = thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2), THREAD_PRIORITY2, 0, thread_func2, NULL, \"thread2\");\n\n    printf(\"Threads created with initial priorities.\\n\");\n\n    // Change priority of the threads for demonstration\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(pid1), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN);\n    sched_change_priority(thread_get(pid2), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN);\n\n    printf(\"Threads priorities have been changed.\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
