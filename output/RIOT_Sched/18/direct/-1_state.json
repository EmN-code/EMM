            "prefix: This code demonstrates how to run two threads in a RIOT OS application on an ESP32, with a mechanism to change their priorities at runtime.\n\n1. **Create Two Threads**: We define two threads, `thread_a` and `thread_b`. Each thread prints a message and pauses for a second. The threads are created with specified stacks and priorities.\n2. **Threads and Priorities**: `THREAD_PRIORITY_A` is initially set higher than `THREAD_PRIORITY_B`.\n3. **Priority Change Simulation**: The code includes an example of simulating changing priorities at runtime. Note that proper handling of thread priority changes would typically require system calls or additional libraries in a real-life application.\n4. **Continuous Execution**: The main function keeps running in an infinite loop to ensure the execution doesn't terminate after thread creation.\n\n**Header Files Used**:\n- `xtimer.h`: For using xtimer functions for sleeping.\n- `thread.h`: Provides functions for thread management including creation and setting priorities. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n\n#define THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN    (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN     (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_A        (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define THREAD_PRIORITY_B        (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2)\n\nchar thread_stack_a[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\nchar thread_stack_b[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n\nvoid *thread_a(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        puts(\"Thread A is running\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *thread_b(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        puts(\"Thread B is running\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    thread_create(thread_stack_a, sizeof(thread_stack_a), THREAD_PRIORITY_A, 0,\n                  thread_a, NULL, \"thread_a\");\n    thread_create(thread_stack_b, sizeof(thread_stack_b), THREAD_PRIORITY_B, 0,\n                  thread_b, NULL, \"thread_b\");\n\n    /* Simulating a change in priority for demonstration */\n    int new_priority_a = THREAD_PRIORITY_B;\n    int new_priority_b = THREAD_PRIORITY_A;\n\n    /* Assuming somehow dynamically changing priority, \n       typically you would need system calls or additional libraries */\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid(), new_priority_a);\n    thread_set_priority(thread_getpid(), new_priority_b);\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n        puts(\"Main thread - simulation ongoing\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
