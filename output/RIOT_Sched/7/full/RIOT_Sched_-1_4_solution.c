# The error message indicates that there are several unknown type names such as 'Timer', 'Network', 'Mutex', and 'Thread'. These appear to be part of an MQTT client library (paho-mqtt), which means the necessary types and dependencies are not being correctly included or recognized.
# The solution involves ensuring that all needed headers are included before 'MQTTClient.h'. Besides, make sure all other necessary dependencies are correctly installed and configured before building the project.

Description of the code solution: The code provided below shows how one could structure a simple RIOT-OS application for an ESP32 platform. It initializes two threads and demonstrates changing their priorities.

## Imports
To resolve the compilation errors, it is crucial to manage the headers effectively. Here, headers are sorted in alphabetical order. This sorting respects the instruction, though it should be noted that some headers may not exist per se in given environments.

```c
#include "ztimer.h"
#include "xtimer.h"
#include "timex.h"
#include "time_units.h"
#include "thread_config.h"
#include "thread_arch.h"
#include "thread.h"
#include "stdatomic.h"
#include "stdbool.h"
#include "stddef.h"
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include "sched.h"
#include "paho_mqtt.h"
#include "evtimer_msg.h"
#include "evtimer_mbox.h"
#include "event/thread.h"
#include "architecture.h"

// Global Variables
#define STACK_SIZE  (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)
char stack1[STACK_SIZE];
char stack2[STACK_SIZE];

kernel_pid_t thread1_pid;
kernel_pid_t thread2_pid;

// Dummy task functions for threads
void *thread_task(void *arg) {
    (void)arg;
    while (1) {
        printf("Thread running\n");
        xtimer_sleep(1);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(void) {
    // Create two threads
    thread1_pid = thread_create(stack1, sizeof(stack1), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, 0, thread_task, NULL, "thread1");
    thread2_pid = thread_create(stack2, sizeof(stack2), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 2, 0, thread_task, NULL, "thread2");

    // Change priority of a thread
    sched_change_priority(thread_get(thread1_pid), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 3);
    printf("Changed priority of thread1\n");

    return 0;
}
```
### Code Outline

1. **Imports**: The code includes all the necessary headers sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Global Variables**: Defines stack sizes and thread IDs for two threads.
3. **Task Function**: A simple function to be executed by each thread that prints a running message.
4. **main Function**: Creates two threads initially and then changes the priority of the first thread, demonstrating the usage of `sched_change_priority`.
