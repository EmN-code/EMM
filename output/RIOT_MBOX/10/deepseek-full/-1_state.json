Implement retry mechanisms as seen in `ref_FSMs`.\n2. **Robust Message Handling**: Consider potential failures in message sending and receiving by introducing additional checks and error states that allow the system to recover or alert the user when a problem occurs.\n3. **Logging in Error States**: Add logging mechanisms when transitioning to error states to aid in debugging and maintaining the system.\n4. **Timer Integration**: Ensure consistent timing-related state transitions by integrating timer validation, similar to `TIMER_SETUP` in the `ref_FSMs`, for potential wait conditions in sending or receiving stages."
