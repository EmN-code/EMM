            "prefix: The code defines a simple RIOT application for ESP32 that uses two threads to demonstrate basic message-passing functionality using a message box. The program defines two threads: a sender and a receiver. The sender thread sends a fixed message to the receiver thread at regular intervals, while the receiver thread waits for messages and prints their contents upon reception. \n\nLet's go over the main components of the code:\n1. **Inclusions and Definitions**: The program starts by including necessary headers from the RIOT OS, and defining stack sizes and priorities for the threads.\n2. **Global Declarations**: This includes stack declarations and thread identifiers for each thread. We also define a message queue to store messages sent by the sender thread.\n3. **Thread Functions**: \n   - `sender_thread`: This function sends a message with a static value to the receiver thread at 1-second intervals.\n   - `receiver_thread`: This function blocks until a message is received and then prints the message.\n4. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we initialize the message queue and create both sender and receiver threads. The use of message queues and threads enables the application to handle asynchronous message-passing effectively.\n\nEnsure all required headers are included at the top in alphabetical order, and the appropriate stack and thread names are correctly defined and used. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <thread.h>\n#include \"msg.h\"\n\n#define SENDER_THREAD_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define RECEIVER_THREAD_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n#define SENDER_THREAD_PRIORITY   (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define RECEIVER_THREAD_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n\nstatic char sender_thread_stack[SENDER_THREAD_STACKSIZE];\nstatic char receiver_thread_stack[RECEIVER_THREAD_STACKSIZE];\nstatic kernel_pid_t sender_thread_pid;\nstatic kernel_pid_t receiver_thread_pid;\n\nstatic msg_t msg_queue[8];\n\nvoid *sender_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void) arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n    while (1) {\n        msg.content.value = 42;  // Example message\n        msg_send(&msg, receiver_thread_pid);\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid *receiver_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void) arg;\n    msg_t msg;\n    while (1) {\n        msg_receive(&msg);\n        printf(\"Received message with value: %lu\\n\", msg.content.value);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    msg_init_queue(msg_queue, 8);\n\n    sender_thread_pid = thread_create(\n        sender_thread_stack, sizeof(sender_thread_stack),\n        SENDER_THREAD_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n        sender_thread, NULL, \"sender_thread\");\n\n    receiver_thread_pid = thread_create(\n        receiver_thread_stack, sizeof(receiver_thread_stack),\n        RECEIVER_THREAD_PRIORITY, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,\n        receiver_thread, NULL, \"receiver_thread\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
