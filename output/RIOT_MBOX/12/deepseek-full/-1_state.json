This is a clear indication that the current code only initializes the event sender.\n- **Loop Transition Differences**: In the `ref_FSMs`, once a running state is established with an event received, it transitions back to start to continue receiving events, whereas in `curr_FSMs`, events are continuously sent and processed without an explicit receiver initialization cycle.\n- **No EXIT Transition**: The `curr_FSMs` lacks an explicit final state like `EXIT` which marks the end of a process lifecycle, unlike the `ref_FSMs`.\n\n### Corrective Measures for `curr_code`:\n1. **Implement Receiver Initialization**: Add a separate thread and FSM state to initialize an event receiver, mirroring the `EVENT_RECEIVER_START` in `ref_FSMs`.\n2. **Lifecycle Management**: Introduce clear cycle states for receiving, processing, and restarting similar to the `ref_FSMs` model.\n3. **Implement Robust Error and Exit States**: Expand error handling and add a clear termination state to improve lifecycle and robustness of the application.\n4. **State Synchronization between Sender and Receiver**: Ensure both threads are synchronized at appropriate points to manage message processing correctly."
