### Current FSM Patterns:
- **INIT -> RUNNING -> WAITING -> RUNNING -> ERROR -> INIT**
  - Threads are created in the INIT state and moved to RUNNING on successful creation. The system loops between RUNNING and WAITING based on message exchange, and moves to ERROR on thread creation failure. It retries from INIT on ERROR.

### Reference FSM Patterns:
1. **START -> THREAD_RUNNING -> CHECK_PRIORITIES -> SWAP_PRIORITIES/NO_ACTION -> THREAD_RUNNING**  
   - Initiates threads, checks thread priorities every 5 seconds, and adjusts them if necessary.
   
2. **INIT -> NETWORK_INIT -> MQTT_INIT -> NETWORK_CONNECT -> MQTT_CONNECT -> PUBLISH**
   - Involves a series of initialization steps, attempting connections, and publishing data at intervals. Retries on failures in network or MQTT connections, going back a step to retry.

### Analysis:
1. **Thread Priority Check:**
   - **Issue:** The `curr_FSM` lacks a strong mechanism to check and adjust thread priorities, which is present in one of the `ref_FSMs`.
   - **Correction:** Introduce a state to periodically evaluate and adjust thread priorities, enhancing operational reliability and performance.

2. **Retry Mechanism:**
   - **Issue:** The current FSM transitions to ERROR directly on thread creation failure, while the reference FSMs include retry logic for network and connection failure states before reaching an error state.
   - **Correction:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism where thread creation failures trigger retries with possible back-off strategies before transitioning to a final ERROR state.

3. **Error Handling and Manual Restart:**
   - **Issue:** The current FSM lacks a detailed mechanism for handling various stages of network or thread failures compared to the detailed error handling in the reference FSMs.
   - **Correction:** Create detailed error states to handle specific failures and automated restart procedures using condition checks similar to mqtt and network reconnect strategies from reference FSMs.

### Conclusion:
To enhance robustness, integrate priority checks and sophisticated retry mechanisms, especially for thread and connection initializations. Additionally, adopting granular error states with specific recovery steps could align the `curr_code` more closely with the resilient patterns demonstrated in the `ref_FSMs`. 
This will lead to improved fault tolerance and system stability.
