The timer is configured to trigger every second, executing a callback function that toggles the LED state, effectively blinking the LED. The program initializes the GPIO pin as an output, defines and initializes an xtimer instance with the callback function, and sets the timer to fire every second. The main loop keeps the microcontroller running continuously, allowing the LED to blink as intended. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2) // Define the GPIO pin connected to the LED\n\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg)\n{\n    (void)arg;\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN); // Toggle the LED state\n    printf(\"LED toggled\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Initialize the LED pin as an output\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n\n    // Define an xtimer instance\n    xtimer_t timer;\n    timer.callback = timer_callback;\n    timer.arg = NULL;\n\n    // Set the timer to trigger every second (1,000,000 microseconds)\n    xtimer_set(&timer, 1000000);\n\n    // Keep the program running indefinitely\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
