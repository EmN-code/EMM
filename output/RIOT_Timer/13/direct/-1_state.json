            "prefix: To develop RIOT code on an ESP32 that sets up a timer to toggle an LED every second, you need to use the RIOT APIs for timers and GPIO. In this example code, we will use the 'xtimer' module for handling the timer and 'gpio' for controlling the LED. \n\n1. We start by including the necessary headers for xtimer, threading, and GPIO management. The headers are included in descending alphabetical order as specified.\n\n2. Define the LED pin using GPIO_PIN macro. Here, we assume the GPIO port 0, pin 2 for the LED, but this may need adjustment depending on your ESP32 setup.\n\n3. Set the desired interval for blinking (1 second in microseconds).\n\n4. Implement a blink function that toggles the LED. This function is executed in an infinite loop and flips the LED state using `gpio_toggle`. After each toggle, it sleeps for 1 second using `xtimer_sleep`.\n\n5. In the `main` function, initialize the LED pin as an output.\n\n6. Create a thread to run the `blink` function using `thread_create`. The main thread remains idle with a loop that continually sleeps, allowing the blink thread to run independently. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // Define LED pin\n#define INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC)  // Set timer interval to 1 second\n\nvoid *blink(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);  // Toggle the LED state\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // Wait 1 second\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);  // Initialize the LED pin as output\n    \n    thread_create(NULL, 0, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN, 0, blink, NULL, \"blink\");  // Create a thread to handle blinking\n\n    // Initial sleep to settle the system (optional)\n    xtimer_sleep(1);  \n\n    // Main thread doesn't do anything, other than sleeping forever\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
