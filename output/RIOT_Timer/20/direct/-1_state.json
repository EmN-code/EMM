            "prefix: This code sets up a timer on an ESP32 using the RIOT OS. It uses the ztimer library to create a recurring 1-second timer that toggles an LED connected to a specific GPIO pin. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Import necessary headers: The code includes `<ztimer/ztimer.h>` for the timer functionality and `<periph/gpio.h>` for GPIO operations.\n2. Define the GPIO pin: The LED is connected to a defined pin on the microcontroller, referred to as `LED_PIN`.\n3. Timer callback function: `timer_callback` is a function that toggles the state of the GPIO pin to turn the LED on and off.\n4. Main function:\n   - Initializes the chosen GPIO pin as an output.\n   - Sets up a timer object that triggers `timer_callback` every second (1000 milliseconds).\n   - Enters an infinite loop where the thread sleeps for 1 second periods to continue the cycle.\n\nThis implementation acknowledges RIOT OS features, specifically the ability to efficiently schedule periodic tasks using a ztimer and manage GPIO pins for hardware control, essential for embedded systems programming with microcontrollers like the ESP32. \n block: #include <ztimer/ztimer.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n// Define the GPIO pin where the LED is connected\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)\n\n// Timer callback function\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;  // Unused parameter\n    // Toggle the LED state\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the GPIO pin as output\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n\n    // Define a ztimer object with 1-second periodic timeout\n    ztimer_t timer;\n    ztimer_set(ZTIMER_MSEC, &timer, 1000, timer_callback, NULL);\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Pause the thread so that it waits for interrupts to trigger\n        ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, 1000);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
