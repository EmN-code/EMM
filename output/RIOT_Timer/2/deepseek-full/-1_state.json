            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: After examining the provided current FSMs and reference FSMs, we can identify the following patterns and discrepancies:\n\n### Pattern Extraction:\n\n**curr_FSMs Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> GPIO_INIT_OK -> TIMER_INIT\n2. TIMER_INIT -> XTIMER_INIT_OK -> RUNNING\n3. RUNNING -> TIMER_TRIGGER -> LED_TOGGLED\n4. LED_TOGGLED -> SLEEP -> RUNNING\n5. Failure in XTIMER_INIT -> ERROR\n6. ERROR -> RESTART -> INIT\n\n**ref_FSMs Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> INIT_OK -> INTERRUPT_DISABLED -> INTERRUPT_HANDLER_SET -> INTERRUPT_ENABLED\n2. INTERRUPT_ENABLED -> INTERRUPT_TRIGGERED -> INTERRUPT_HANDLED\n3. INTERRUPT_HANDLED -> ATOMIC_VAR_INCREMENTED -> VERIFY_ATOMIC_VAR\n4. VERIFY_ATOMIC_VAR -> VERIFICATION_SUCCESS -> END\n5. On VERIFICATION_FAILED -> ERROR\n6. ERROR -> REINIT -> INIT\n\n**Another Pattern in ref_FSMs:**\n1. INIT -> START -> WIFI_INIT\n2. WIFI_INIT -> WIFI_INIT_SUCCESS -> WIFI_CONNECTED\n3. WIFI_CONNECTED -> WIFI_IS_CONNECTED -> COAP_SEND\n4. COAP_SEND -> GCOAP_MEMO_RESP_SUCCESS -> COAP_SEND (loop)\n5. If WIFI_INIT or COAP SEND fails -> ERROR\n6. ERROR -> HANDLE_ERROR_RECOVERY -> WIFI_INIT\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Lack of Interrupt Handling:** The current FSM does not incorporate any stages to handle interrupts. In systems where timed actions such as toggling LEDs are dependent on hardware interrupts, failing to model these can lead to non-robust implementations especially if the timer fails or if the toggling process hangs.\n\n2. **Error Handling and Recovery:** The ref_FSMs emphasize robust error handling and recovery, particularly through distinct error recovery states and transitions (like HANDLE_ERROR_RECOVERY). The current FSM solely loops back to INIT on errors. This method lacks specificity and a structured way to categorize different types of failures and recovery actions.\n\n3. **Atomic Operation Verification:** The ref_FSMs make use of atomic operations verification. This is absent in the current FSM, potentially leading to issues in systems where concurrent processes need synchronization.\n\n4. **Functional Completeness:** The current FSM focusses more heavily on the timer and LED aspects without networking, whereas the reference FSMs integrate networking and further system interactions.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n1. Incorporate interrupt handlings such as enabling and handling interrupts in the program and FSM.\n2. Implement structured error handling with separate states for different recovery actions, rather than looping directly to INIT.\n3. Include states or mechanisms to verify successful completion of actions, such as toggling, typically through atomic operations or hardware acknowledgments.\n4. Extend the functionality to consider network interaction or additional peripheral devices, if relevant, as seen in part of the ref_FSM."
