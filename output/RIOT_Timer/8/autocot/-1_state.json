            "prefix: This code snippet is designed to run on an ESP32 using the RIOT operating system. The objective is to set up a timer that triggers every second to turn on an LED. Here's an explanation of the code solution:\n\n1. **Include Necessary Headers**: We include `xtimer.h` for timer-related functions and `periph/gpio.h` for GPIO functions. `stdio.h` is included for potential debugging purposes via `printf()`.\n\n2. **Define Constants**:\n   - `LED_PIN`: This defines the GPIO pin where the LED is connected. You should replace `PORT_A, 5` with the actual port and pin number based on your ESP32 setup.\n   - `INTERVAL`: Set to `1U * US_PER_SEC`, which defines a 1-second interval using the `xtimer` library's predefined macro `US_PER_SEC` for microseconds per second.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Initialize the specified `LED_PIN` as an output pin using `gpio_init()`.\n   - Enter an infinite loop where:\n     - The LED is turned on by setting the pin high with `gpio_set()`.\n     - The program sleeps for the defined interval using `xtimer_usleep()`, effectively keeping the LED on for 1 second.\n     - The LED is then turned off by clearing the pin with `gpio_clear()`.\n     - The program sleeps again for the same interval, keeping the LED off for another second.\n\nThis loop continues indefinitely, effectively blinking the LED on and off every second. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(PORT_A, 5) // Assuming the LED is connected to PORT_A pin 5\n#define INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC)  // 1-second interval\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize LED_PIN as output\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    \n    while (1) {\n        // Set the LED_PIN high\n        gpio_set(LED_PIN);\n        // Wait for the interval duration\n        xtimer_usleep(INTERVAL);\n        // Set the LED_PIN low\n        gpio_clear(LED_PIN);\n        // Wait for the interval duration\n        xtimer_usleep(INTERVAL);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
