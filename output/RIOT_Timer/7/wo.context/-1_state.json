The error suggests that the function `xtimer_set_callback` is not found, which means we might be using an incorrect function or missing some setup. Instead, we should use the `xtimer_set` function which is part of the xtimer API in RIOT and is used to set timers with a specific callback. Here\u2019s a refined and corrected version of your code, which includes setting up the led pin, initializing the timer, and setting its callback. Also, ensure the header files are included in the correct order as specified. This should resolve the implicit function declaration error by using the correct function available in the xtimer library. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <thread.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2) // Change as per your board's LED pin\n#define TIMER_INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC)\n\nstatic void timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    static xtimer_t timer;\n    timer.callback = timer_callback;\n    timer.arg = NULL;\n    xtimer_set(&timer, TIMER_INTERVAL);\n\n    while (1) {\n        thread_yield();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
