FSM with GPIO and Temperature Check:\n   - `GPIO_INIT_OK` -> READ_DHT\n   - `TEMP_GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD` -> LED_ON\n   - `TEMP_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_THRESHOLD` -> LED_OFF\n   - `TEMP_EVENT_POSTED` -> WAIT\n   - `EVENT_RECEIVED` -> READ_DHT\n2. FSM with Network Connection:\n   - `SERVER_IP_VALID && SOCKET_CREATED` -> TIMER_SETUP\n   - `!SERVER_IP_VALID` -> ERROR\n   - `!SOCKET_CREATED` -> ERROR\n   - `TIMER_INITIALIZED` -> SEND_STATE\n   - `MSG_RECEIVED` -> SEND_STATE\n   - `RETRY_CONNECTION` -> INIT\n\n#### Analysis of Pattern Differences:\n- **curr_FSMs:** focuses on GPIO initialization, timer setup, and periodic LED toggling. It does not handle any recalibration for initialization errors except transitioning to an error state.\n- **ref_FSMs:** include handling and retry mechanisms state transitions. The temperature-based FSM has a clear action-response flow triggered by conditions, whereas the network-based FSM includes retries in case of errors.\n\n#### Incorrect Matching Patterns in curr_code:\n1. **Lack of Retry Mechanism**:\n   - curr_code does not implement any retry mechanism if initialization fails, either in GPIO or the Timer setup.\n\n2. **No Error State Handling**:\n   - Once transitioned to an ERROR state, there is no logic to recover or attempt a retry.\n\n3. **Static Timer Operation**:\n   - The timer operates without any dynamic interaction as seen in the reference FSM patterns where operations depend on certain triggers or events (e.g., temperature thresholds, message receptions).\n\n#### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Introduce Retry Logic**:\n   - Implement retry mechanisms for GPIO and Timer initialization. When any initialization fails, try again after a certain delay instead of transitioning directly to an error state.\n   \n2. **Implement Error Recovery**:\n   - Create a state to handle error recovery, transitioning from ERROR back to the retry logic, possibly after logging or alerting about the error.\n\n3. **Dynamic Interaction**:\n   - Enhance the code by introducing trigger-based actions, such as changing LED states based on external conditions or events, aligning more with multi-triggered processes seen in the ref_FSMs."
