            "prefix: The error message indicates that there was an implicit declaration of the function 'xtimer_seconds'. This likely means that the function was not properly declared or included in the headers used. In RIOT, to achieve the desired functionality, we will use the 'xtimer' library, specifically leveraging the 'xtimer_sleep' function, which is explicitly provided by this library. We'll then set up a simple LED timer example, ensure that headers are included in alphabetical order, and execute the timer in the main function. Note that for ESP32 platforms, GPIO pin configuration must be done to control the LED state. Below is the corrected RIOT code solution for setting up a timer and controlling an LED on an ESP32. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>  // Include xtimer for timer functions\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>  // Include GPIO peripheral to control I/O pins\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // Define the GPIO pin for the LED, assuming ESP32 and LED is on GPIO pin 2\n\n// Function to initialize the LED pin\nvoid init_led(void) {\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n}\n\n// Main function to control the flow\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the LED pin\n    init_led();\n\n    // Timer loop\n    while (1) {\n        gpio_set(LED_PIN);  // Turn on the LED\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // Sleep for 1 second\n        gpio_clear(LED_PIN);  // Turn off the LED\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // Sleep for 1 second\n    }\n    return 0;  // Typically not reached in an embedded application\n} \n"
