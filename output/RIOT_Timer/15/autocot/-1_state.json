            "prefix: This code sets up a repeating timer on a RIOT operating system running on an ESP32, which will trigger every second to turn on an LED. It uses the available timer functions from RIOT to initialize a timer, set its frequency, and attach a callback function. When triggered, the callback function will control an LED by turning it on. \n\nTo begin, we need to define and initialize the timer after including the required RIOT headers, sorted in descending alphabetical order:\n1. evtimer.h: If event timers are needed (though the core timer functionality doesn't specifically require this).\n2. Timer.h: We use the functions defined in this header to configure and control timers.\n\nWe then initialize the timer device, set its frequency to 1 Hz, and start the timer. We define a callback function `timer_cb` to handle the timer event, where we will control the LED by simulating the turn-on function. \n block: #include <timex.h>\n#include <timer.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n// GPIO pin to which the LED is connected\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)\n\n// Timer device\nstatic tim_t timer_dev = TIMER_DEV(0);\n\n// Callback function for the timer\nvoid timer_cb(void *arg)\n{\n    (void)arg;\n    // Toggle the LED state \n    if (gpio_read(LED_PIN) == 0) {\n        gpio_set(LED_PIN);\n    } else {\n        gpio_clear(LED_PIN);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Initialize the GPIO for the LED\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    \n    // Set up the timer\n    uint32_t frequency = 1; // 1 Hz frequency for 1 second interval\n    timer_init(timer_dev, frequency, timer_cb, NULL);\n    \n    // Start the timer\n    timer_start(timer_dev);\n\n    // Keep main thread running\n    while (1) {\n        // Implement low-power waits or other functionality if necessary\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
