            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: **Pattern Extraction:**\n- **curr_FSMs Pattern:**\n  1. INIT (LED initialization success) -> TIMER_INIT\n  2. TIMER_INIT (Timer set success) -> RUNNING\n  3. RUNNING (Timer callback triggered) -> LED_TOGGLE\n  4. LED_TOGGLE (LED toggle complete) -> RUNNING\n\n- **ref_FSMs Pattern:**\n  1. INIT (GPIO initialization success) -> READ_DHT\n  2. READ_DHT (Temperature condition met) -> LED_ON / LED_OFF\n  3. LED_ON / LED_OFF (Temperature event posted) -> WAIT\n  4. WAIT (Event received) -> READ_DHT\n\n**Analysis of Differences:**\n1. The curr_FSMs focuses on a simple periodic LED toggle without any sensor reading or conditions to trigger different states, unlike the ref_FSMs which involve environmental data (temperature) to make state transitions.\n2. The ref_FSMs include more sophisticated conditional transitions based on sensor data which is entirely absent in the curr_FSMs.\n3. ref_FSMs include handling errors and event-driven actions, while the curr_FSMs lack any error handling mechanism.\n\n**Incorrect Matching Patterns & Corrective Measures:**\n- curr_FSMs lacks complexity and robustness found in ref_FSMs, which includes handling conditions based on sensor data and proper error handling and recovery.\n- **Corrective Measure:** Introduce an initialization state that checks for GPIO initialization, incorporate condition-based transitions (such as temperature checks if relevant), and ensure error-handling transitions are present.\n- Consider adding states and transitions to handle sensor data or other real-time feedback to increase robustness and operational relevance similar to ref_FSMs."
