            "prefix: This RIOT-OS code for the ESP32 uses a 1-second timer to toggle an LED connected to a specific GPIO pin. The application is structured as follows:\n\n1. **Include necessary libraries:** We use `xtimer.h` for time-related functions and `periph/gpio.h` for GPIO manipulation. These are sorted in descending alphabetical order based on your requirements.\n\n2. **Define the LED toggle function:** `toggle_led()` is a simple function that toggles the state of the LED GPIO pin.\n\n3. **Main function:**\n   - We initialize the GPIO pin designated for the LED as an output.\n   - The main loop uses the `xtimer_periodic_wakeup` to create a 1-second periodic timer. In each loop iteration, it toggles the LED state using `toggle_led()`.\n   - The `xtimer_now()` provides the current time, which is used to determine the starting point for periodic triggering. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n// Function to toggle LED state\nvoid toggle_led(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg; // Unused parameter\n    gpio_toggle(GPIO_PIN(0, 2));\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the LED pin\n    gpio_init(GPIO_PIN(0, 2), GPIO_OUT);\n    \n    // Set up a 1-second timer\n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, 1000000);\n        toggle_led(NULL);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
