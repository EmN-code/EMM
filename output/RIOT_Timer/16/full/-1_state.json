            "prefix: We are tasked with developing RIOT OS code for an ESP32 board that sets up a timer to trigger every second. When the timer triggers, an LED connected to the ESP32 should be turned on. We're going to use RIOT's timer functionalities to achieve this.\n\nFirstly, we'll include the necessary header files for working with the timer and the GPIO for controlling the LED. We'll create a timer that triggers every second using the `xtimer_sleep()` function.\n\nEach time the timer event is triggered, we'll set the GPIO pin connected to the LED high to turn it on. We'll also ensure that our code handles LED peripheral initialization properly.\n\nWithout using specific constants like \"ESP_IF_WIFI_STA\" and \"IPV4\", we'll focus solely on the LED functionality and timer setup. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // Use GPIO pin 2 (adjust based on actual setup)\n\nvoid timer_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    \n    // Toggle LED state\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the LED_PIN as an output\n    if (gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT)) {\n        printf(\"Error: unable to initialize LED GPIO pin\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Infinite loop to toggle LED every second\n    while (1) {\n        timer_handler(NULL);\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // Wait for one second\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
