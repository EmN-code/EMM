            "prefix: This RIOT code for an ESP32 sets up a timer that triggers every second. When the timer triggers, it toggles an LED. Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Include Header Files**: The necessary headers are included for using peripheral GPIO and timer functions. They are sorted in descending alphabetical order by their first letter.\n\n2. **Define LED Pin**: A macro `LED_PIN` is defined to specify the GPIO pin for the LED. It assumes the LED is connected to PORT_B at pin 5, but this can be adjusted based on your hardware setup.\n\n3. **Timer Interval**: An interval of 1 second is defined as `INTERVAL` in microseconds.\n\n4. **Callback Function**: The `timer_callback` function is defined to toggle the LED whenever it's called. It also prints a message to the console for verification.\n\n5. **Main Function**:\n   - The LED pin is initialized as an output. If the initialization fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.\n   - A periodic wakeup mechanism is set up using `xtimer_periodic_wakeup` to wake every second (as defined by `INTERVAL`).\n   - In each cycle, the `timer_callback` function is called to toggle the LED.\n\nThis is a simple example showing how to use RIOT\u2019s timer and GPIO interfaces to toggle an LED in a periodic manner on the ESP32 platform. The code should be compiled and flashed onto the ESP32 using the specific RIOT build system and environment for ESP32. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(PORT_B, 5)\n#define INTERVAL 1000000U // 1 second in microseconds\n\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n    printf(\"LED toggled!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the LED pin as an output\n    if (gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT) < 0) {\n        printf(\"Error: Unable to initialize the LED pin\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n    while (1) {\n        // Wait for the next tick\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, INTERVAL);\n        // Toggle LED in the callback\n        timer_callback(NULL);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
