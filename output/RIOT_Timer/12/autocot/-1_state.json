            "prefix: In this code, we'll implement a simple program for the ESP32 using the RIOT operating system that sets up a timer to trigger every second and toggle an LED. Here's how we can go about it:\n\n1. **Include Necessary Headers**: We'll include headers for time functions, timer utilities, GPIO operations, and standard input/output functions.\n\n2. **Define GPIO Pin for the LED**: We'll assume the LED is connected to GPIO pin 0.2. This can be changed according to your specific hardware configuration.\n\n3. **Timer Callback Function**: We'll write a callback function `timer_callback`, which toggles the state of the LED whenever it is called. This function uses `gpio_toggle()` to change the LED state.\n\n4. **Initialize GPIO**: In the `main()` function, initialize the GPIO pin as an output pin so it can drive the LED.\n\n5. **Set Up the Timer**: We will use `ztimer_t` which is a timer structure. We define a timer with a callback that fires every 1 second by setting it to `US_PER_SEC` (microseconds per second).\n\n6. **Start the Timer**: Using `ztimer_set`, start the timer with a 1-second interval.\n\n7. **Main Loop**: Keep the program running with an idle loop in `main()`, since the timer uses interrupts to trigger the LED toggle. \n block: #include <timex.h>\n#include <ztimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2) // Assume LED is connected to pin 0.2\n\nstatic void timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    // Toggle the LED state\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the GPIO pin for the LED to output mode\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    \n    // Define a timer with a 1-second interval\n    ztimer_t timer;\n    timer.callback = timer_callback;\n    timer.arg = NULL;\n    timer.min_interval = US_PER_SEC; // 1 second\n\n    // Set the timer\n    ztimer_set(ZTIMER_SEC, &timer, 1);\n    \n    // Run the main program loop which does not do much in this case\n    while (1) {\n        // Idle loop to keep the program running\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
