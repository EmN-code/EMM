            "prefix: The goal is to create a program for the ESP32 board using RIOT OS that sets up a timer. This timer will toggle a GPIO pin that controls an LED on and off every second. Here's how the solution is structured in code:\n\n1. **Imports**: We include the necessary headers for using the xtimer and controlling peripheral GPIO pins.\n2. **LED Pin Definition**: Define which GPIO pin the LED is connected to.\n3. **Timer Callback**: A function (`timer_callback`) is defined to change the LED state. The LED state is toggled each time this function is called.\n4. **Main Function**: \n   - Initialize the GPIO pin as an output.\n   - Set up a periodic wakeup using the xtimer every second.\n   - In each loop iteration, call the timer callback to toggle the LED state.\n\nThis setup avoids the use of undeclared ports by directly specifying `GPIO_PIN(port, pin)` and uses an ESP32 appropriate method to control the peripherals. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // Assuming the LED is connected to GPIO port 0, pin 2\n\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    static int led_state = 0;\n    led_state = !led_state;  // Toggle LED state\n    gpio_write(LED_PIN, led_state);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    \n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n    \n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, 1 * US_PER_SEC);\n        timer_callback(NULL);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
