            "prefix: This code sets up a timer on the RIOT OS for an ESP32 microcontroller that triggers every second and toggles an LED. Here's how the code works:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We include the necessary libraries for time management (`ztimer.h`, `timex.h`), threading support (`thread.h`), and GPIO control (`periph/gpio.h`). These libraries provide the functions and types needed to set up and control the timer and the GPIO pins for the LED.\n\n2. **Define Constants**: We define the LED pin using the `GPIO_PIN` macro to specify the correct port and pin functions. The interval defined by `INTERVAL` is set to 1 second (in microseconds) using `US_PER_SEC` for conversion.\n\n3. **Timer Callback Function**: The `timer_callback` function toggles the LED state (on or off) each time it's called. This function gets executed every time the timer elapses.\n\n4. **Initialize GPIO for the LED**: We use `gpio_init` to set up the LED pin as an output.\n\n5. **Configure and Start the Timer**: We define a `ztimer_t` timer object and set its callback and interval. Then, we start the timer with `ztimer_start`, using the `ZTIMER_MSEC` clock source.\n\n6. **Main Event Loop**: In the `while(1)` loop, we call `thread_yield()` continuously, allowing the RIOT scheduler to manage the task execution, ensuring our application remains responsive and can execute other tasks or respond to interrupts as needed.\n\nThe whole implementation demonstrates basic timer usage and GPIO management on RIOT OS for a periodic task such as toggling an LED. \n block: #include <ztimer.h>\n#include \"timex.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(PORT_A, 5)  // Substitute PORT_A with the correct port for your board\n#define INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC)  // 1 second interval\n\nstatic void timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    gpio_toggle(LED_PIN);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    gpio_init(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n    ztimer_t timer;\n    timer.callback = timer_callback;\n    timer.arg = NULL;\n    ztimer_start(ZTIMER_MSEC, &timer, INTERVAL);\n\n    while (1) {\n        thread_yield();  // Let the RIOT scheduler do its work\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
