            "prefix: To solve the undeclared 'PORT_A' error and create a RIOT application for an ESP32 that sets up a timer to toggle an LED every second, follow these steps. First, ensure that you include the correct RIOT OS headers needed for timer and GPIO functionalities. Here, we make use of `xtimer.h` for timer operations and handle the LED toggling within the timer's callback function. The timer is configured to trigger every second using `xtimer_set`, and the LED state is toggled within the callback by printing status to the console. Ensure you configure the GPIO pin appropriately for the ESP32 so that actual LED operations work as expected. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>  // Include xtimer for timer functionality\n#include <stdio.h>   // For input-output purposes\n#include <event/callback.h>  // Include event/callback for handling events\n\n#define TIMER_INTERVAL (1U * 1000000U)  // 1 second in microseconds\n#define LED_PIN GPIO_PIN(0,2)  // Define the LED pin.
