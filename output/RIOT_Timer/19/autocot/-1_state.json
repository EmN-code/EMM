            "prefix: In this solution, we will develop RIOT code to set up a timer on an ESP32 that triggers every second to turn on a LED. We will use the timer API provided in the RIOT documentation to configure the timer and trigger an interrupt every second. The code will utilize the `uart_write()` function to write data to the UART, simulating an LED turn on action because we lack a specific function provided in the documentation for directly controlling the GPIO to turn on an LED. We will involve key RIOT API functions such as `timer_init()`, `timer_start()`, and `TimerCountdownMS()` to achieve this. This demonstration is a simulation of the LED functionality and real LED control will require proper GPIO handling that's specific to the target hardware.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a timer with a 1-second interval.\n2. In the timer callback, simulate turning on an LED by writing to the UART.\n3. Start the timer. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <tim.h>\n#include <uart.h>\n\n#define TIMER_FREQUENCY 1000  // Frequency in Hz\n\nstatic tim_t timer_dev = 0;  // The timer device to use\nstatic uart_t uart_dev = 0;  // UART device, dev 0 used for demonstrating\n\n// Timer callback function\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    const uint8_t led_on_message[] = \"LED ON\\n\";\n    uart_write(uart_dev, led_on_message, sizeof(led_on_message) - 1);\n    // Reset the timer counting\ntimer_init(timer_dev, TIMER_FREQUENCY, timer_callback, NULL);\n    timer_start(timer_dev);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    puts(\"Starting timer example...\");\n\n    // Initialize UART (assumed initialized for demo purposes)\n    // Initialize Timer\n    if (timer_init(timer_dev, TIMER_FREQUENCY, timer_callback, NULL) < 0) {\n        puts(\"Error initializing timer\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Start Timer\n    timer_start(timer_dev);\n\n    // Keep the program running\n    while (1) {}\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
