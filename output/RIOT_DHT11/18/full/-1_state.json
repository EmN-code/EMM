            "prefix: The task is to implement a RIOT application on an ESP32 that reads data from a DHT11 sensor every five seconds. The DHT11 sensor is connected to GPIO 2. This solution will make use of RIOT's DHT driver, the `xtimer` module for timing, and handle potential connection issues gracefully with a retry mechanism. We will use the `dht_read` function to get temperature and humidity data from the sensor. If any errors occur while reading the sensor, the code will handle these errors and attempt to re-read after a short delay. This involves initializing the DHT11 sensor according to its specifications, configuring GPIO appropriately, and using an infinite loop to read sensor data every five seconds while checking for errors. We'll employ error handling to retry accessing the DHT11 sensor in the case of a read failure. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"dht.h\"\n#include \"dht_params.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define DHT_TYPE DHT11\n#define DHT_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)\n#define INTERVAL (5U * US_PER_SEC)\n\nint main(void) {\n    dht_t dev;\n    int16_t temp, hum;\n    int rc;\n\n    dht_params_t params;\n    params.pin = DHT_PIN;\n    params.type = DHT_TYPE;\n\n    rc = dht_init(&dev, &params);\n    if (rc != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to initialize DHT sensor\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    while(1) {\n        rc = dht_read(&dev, &temp, &hum);\n        if (rc != 0) {\n            printf(\"DHT read failed\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d.%d%%\\n\", temp / 10, temp % 10, hum / 10, hum % 10);\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
