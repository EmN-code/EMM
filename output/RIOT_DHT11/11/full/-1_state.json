            "prefix: To develop a RIOT code that reads data from a DHT11 sensor connected to GPIO 2 on an ESP32 every five seconds, you can use the following approach. This involves using the DHT and peripheral GPIO libraries to initialize and read the sensor data. The xtimer library is used to implement the delay between readings. Ensure that the DHT11 sensor is correctly wired to the ESP32 and that GPIO 2 is used as specified. The below code initializes the sensor and continually reads temperature and humidity values with a delay of 5 seconds in between readings. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/gpio.h>\n#include <dht_params.h>\n#include <dht.h>\n\n#define DHT_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2)  // GPIO 2\n#define READ_INTERVAL (5U * US_PER_SEC)  // Interval to read the sensor\n\nstatic dht_t dev;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    puts(\"ESP32 DHT11 Reader\");\n\n    // Initialize DHT11 sensor\n    dht_params_t params = {\n        .pin = DHT_PIN,\n        .type = DHT11\n    };\n\n    if (dht_init(&dev, &params) != DHT_OK) {\n        puts(\"Error initializing DHT11\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Read loop\n    while (1) {\n        int16_t temperature, humidity;\n\n        // Read sensor data\n        if (dht_read(&dev, &temperature, &humidity) == DHT_OK) {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d%%\\n\", temperature / 10, humidity / 10);\n        } else {\n            puts(\"Failed to read DHT11 sensor\");\n        }\n\n        // Wait for the next measurement\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
