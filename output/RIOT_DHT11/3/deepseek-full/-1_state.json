            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Incorrect Pattern in curr_FSMs\n\nThe current FSMs have a logical flow including states INIT, READ, SLEEP, and ERROR. The transitions are based on conditions relating to the DHT sensor's status. However, there is an issue with how the states transition between each other as compared to the reference FSMs.\n\n### Patterns in curr_FSMs\n1. **INIT**:\n   - On successful initialization (DHT_INIT_OK), transition to **READ**.\n   - On initialization failure (DHT_INIT_FAIL), transition to **ERROR**.\n\n2. **READ**:\n   - On successful read (DHT_READ_OK), transition to **SLEEP**.\n   - On read failure (DHT_READ_FAIL), transition to **SLEEP**. Here lies a major concern.\n\n3. **SLEEP**:\n   - After the sleep interval expires (TIMER_EXPIRE), transition to **READ**.\n\n4. **ERROR**:\n   - On a manual reset (MANUAL_RESET), transition back to **INIT**.\n\n### Patterns in ref_FSMs\n1. **INIT**:\n   - On successful initialization (DHT_INIT_OK), transition to **READ_DHT**.\n   - On initialization failure (DHT_INIT_FAIL), transition to **ERROR**.\n\n2. **READ_DHT**:\n   - On successful read (DHT_READ_OK), transition to **SLEEP**.\n   - On read failure (DHT_READ_FAIL), *remain in READ_DHT*, attempting to read again.\n\n3. **SLEEP**:\n   - On timer expiry (TIMER_EXPIRED), transition back to **READ_DHT**.\n\n4. **ERROR**:\n   - No transitions defined, indicating an indefinite error state unless otherwise handled externally.\n\n### Incorrect Matching and Suggestions\n- In the curr_FSMs, on a read failure in **READ**, the system transitions to **SLEEP**, making another attempt only after the sleep interval. \n  - **Correction**: On a read failure, the system should retry immediately as observed in ref_FSMs, staying in the **READ_DHT** state. \n  - This ensures prompt reattempt of reading, possibly reducing data latency or handling transient errors more effectively.\n- Change \"READ\" state to \"READ_DHT\" for consistency with ref_FSMs.\n- Ensure predictable error logging or manual intervention paths are clear, especially since the **ERROR** state lacks transition in the ref_FSM.\n\nThe current implementation needs enhancement in the **READ** state handling on failures to increase data reliability and reduce elapsed time between attempts."
