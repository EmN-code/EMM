The DHT11 will be connected to GPIO 2 of the ESP32. We'll make use of the provided RIOT documentation functions such as `dht_init` and `dht_read` to read the sensor data. We'll also include error handling and retesting logic for robustness, retrying operations where necessary. The program will run indefinitely, printing out the readings every five seconds. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"dht.h\"\n\n#define DHT_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2) // GPIO 2 for DHT11\n#define DHT_TYPE DHT11\n#define LOOP_INTERVAL (5U * 1000000U) // 5 seconds in microseconds\n\nint main(void) {\n    dht_t dev;\n    dht_params_t params;\n    int16_t temperature, humidity;\n    int res;\n\n    params.pin = DHT_PIN;\n    params.type = DHT_TYPE;\n    res = dht_init(&dev, &params);\n    if (res != DHT_OK) {\n        printf(\"Failed to initialize DHT sensor\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        res = dht_read(&dev, &temperature, &humidity);\n        if ((res != DHT_OK)) {\n            printf(\"Failed to read data from DHT sensor\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d.%d%%\\n\", \n                   temperature / 10, temperature % 10, \n                   humidity / 10, humidity % 10);\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(LOOP_INTERVAL / 1000000U);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
