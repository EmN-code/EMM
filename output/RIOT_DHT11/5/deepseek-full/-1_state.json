            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: The current FSMs: \n1. **INIT** \u2236 DHT_INIT_OK -> READ_SENSOR\n   DHT_INIT_FAIL -> ERROR \n2. **READ_SENSOR** \u2236 DHT_READ_OK -> SLEEP\n   DHT_READ_FAIL -> ERROR\n3. **SLEEP** \u2236 TIMER_EXPIRED -> READ_SENSOR\n4. **ERROR** \u2236 RETRY -> INIT\n\nThe referenced FSMs focus more on setting up and error handling. They contain logic for network initialization and data reading that both aren't covered in the current FSMs.\n\n1. In REFROWNED, after INIT, it continues to **NETWORK_INIT** if DHT_INIT_OK. After network setup (**THREAD_CREATED**) or periodic event initiation (**EVENT_INIT_OK**) it transitions to **DATA_READ** or **PERIODIC_EVENT_START** respectively.\n\n2. **DATA_READ** states with **DHT_READ_SUCCESS** as well as **DHT_READ_FAIL** transition to **SLEEP**. Thus, irrespective of the data reading success/failure, the system continues rather than stopping immediately upon failure, promoting resilience.\n\n3. In the ERROR states, there isn\u2019t a transition back with a retry condition from ERROR to INIT for both patterns, suggesting the existing robust handling.\n\n**Incorrect Matching and Recommendations**:\n1. The current code directly transitions to **ERROR** on failure and expect retrying. Reflected FSMs move to **SLEEP**, not causing abrupt termination, suggesting implementing a **sleep-and-retry** loop for failures.\n\n2. Network initialization is absent.\n3. Introduce NETWORK_INIT and a handler for THREAD_CREATED or PERIODIC_EVENT_INIT as seen in referenced FSM, to cushion initialization failures and encourage robustness.\n\n4. RED sensor should handle readings failure by transitioning to sleep and try rather than immediate failure to initiate sequence grounding."
