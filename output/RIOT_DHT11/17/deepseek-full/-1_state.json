The ref_FSMs provide a distinct separation between sensor initialization (`START`) and thread creation (`DHT_THREAD_INIT`).\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - The curr_FSMs have a recovery from the `ERROR` state that goes back to `INIT`, implying a retry mechanism after handling an error. The ref_FSMs only point to `ERROR` from both initialization and reading failures, without specifying recovery logic.\n\n3. **SLEEP/Timer Mechanism:**\n   - Both FSMs mention the use of a sleep mechanism (`xtimer_usleep`), but the placement in curr_FSMs occurs in `PROCESS_DATA`, while ref_FSMs perform sleep in `SLEEP`, a more dedicated sleep state after reading.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n\n1. **Separate Thread Initialization Logic:**\n   - Add an additional state or logic in the code to separate sensor initialization and thread creation.\n\n2. **Clarify Error Handling Mechanism:**\n   - Consider implementing or clarifying the error handling and retry logic in the ref_FSMs to match curr_FSMs if a retry mechanism is desired.\n\n3. **Refactor Sleep Logic:**\n   - Ensure sleep occurs in a dedicated state post-reading, similar to the ref_FSMs\u2019 `SLEEP` state, which might imply timing or threading issues.\n\nBy following these corrective measures, you can ensure that the curr_code aligns more closely with robust FSM design as suggested by the ref_FSMs."
