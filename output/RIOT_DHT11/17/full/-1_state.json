In this example, we use the `dht` library to initialize and read from the sensor. The GPIO2 is defined for the sensor connection, and we will repeatedly attempt to initialize the sensor until successful. Then, in a loop, it reads values every five seconds and outputs the readings to the standard output. The loop includes exception handling to deal with potential failures in reading data. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <dht.h>\n\n#define DHT_PIN GPIO_PIN(0, 2) // GPIO2 on ESP32\n#define SLEEP_INTERVAL (5U * US_PER_SEC) // Sleep interval of 5 seconds\n\nint main(void) {\n    dht_t dev;\n    int16_t temperature, humidity;\n    int rc;\n\n    rc = dht_init(&dev, &(dht_params_t){ .pin = DHT_PIN, .type = DHT11 });\n    while (rc != 0) {\n        printf(\"DHT sensor initialization failed.
