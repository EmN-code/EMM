However, the reference FSMs are mainly designed for network operations, while the current FSMs focus on sensor operations. The main concept divergence lies in the external operation (network vs. sensor) yet, both rely on effective error handling and retry mechanisms.\n\n### Current Code Issues and Recommendations:\n1. **Thread and Timing Errors**:\n   - The `dht_thread` function has a while loop for continuous execution, sleeping at intervals, but lacks checks for an exit condition. Instead of infinitely looping with usleep, consider implementing sufficient exit or error conditions, e.g., a controlled shutdown mechanism.\n   \n2. **Error Handling Robustness**:\n   - The transition from ERROR to INIT in the current FSM relies on a \"RETRY\" condition which lacks implementation in the current code. This absence is not conducive to robust recovery from sensor initialization or read errors.\n   - Introduce a retry policy with a backoff strategy. For instance, after encountering an error, wait for longer durations before retrying and eventually, if persistent failure, halt retry and log for human intervention.\n\n3. **Graceful Degradation or Notifications**:\n   - While failing to initialize or read does print a message, this is not robust for real-world scenarios. Consider implementing fallback actions or external notifications for critical application management.\n\n4. **Synchronization and Concurrency**:\n   - With looping threads and potential sensor access issues, it\u2019s essential to ensure that there are checks for concurrency issues that may arise, particularly when integrating other tasks or modules into the system.\n\nBy addressing the above recommendations, the sensor application will gain increased reliability, stability, and adherence to the FSM-driven process flow."
