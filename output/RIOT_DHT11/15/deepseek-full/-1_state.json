            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: **Extracted Patterns from FSMs:**\n\n**Curr_FSMs:**\n1. GPIO_INIT (-> GPIO_INIT_SUCCESS) -> DHT_INIT\n2. DHT_INIT (-> DHT_INIT_SUCCESS) -> READ_SENSOR\n3. READ_SENSOR (-> DHT_READ_SUCCESS) -> SLEEP\n4. SLEEP (-> TIMER_EXPIRED) -> READ_SENSOR\n5. ERROR (no transition)\n\n**Ref_FSMs:**\n1. INIT (-> GPIO_INIT_OK) -> READ_DHT\n2. READ_DHT (-> TEMP_GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD) -> LED_ON\n   READ_DHT (-> TEMP_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_THRESHOLD) -> LED_OFF\n3. LED_ON (-> TEMP_EVENT_POSTED) -> WAIT\n4. LED_OFF (-> TEMP_EVENT_POSTED) -> WAIT\n5. WAIT (-> EVENT_RECEIVED) -> READ_DHT\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Differences:**\n1. **Initialization States:**\n   - The curr_FSMs starts with separate states: GPIO_INIT and DHT_INIT, transitioning to an ERROR state in case of failure. In contrast, the ref_FSMs have a single INIT state.\n   - This implies that the curr_code handles GPIO and DHT initialization separately which is more granular, whereas the ref_FSMs suggest a need for combined initialization checks or a simpler abstraction in a single state.\n\n2. **Read Sensor States:**\n   - In curr_FSMs, the sensor reading is simple and transitions to SLEEP if successful, or ERROR if not.\n   - The ref_FSMs expect further actions post sensor read, specifically branching into two states: LED_ON and LED_OFF, depending on some condition (likely related to temperature).\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - The curr_FSMs transitions to an ERROR state upon any initialization failure or read failure, with no further transitions. However, the ref_FSMs support recovery or state transition post error handling which includes posting events and waiting for conditions.\n\n4. **Use of Output State (LED control):**\n   - The ref_FSMs specifies LEDs turned ON or OFF based on temperature thresholds; the curr_FSMs lacks any actuation or event-based reactions post temperature or humidity read.\n\n---\n\n**Corrective Measures:**\n1. **Merge Initialization:**\n   - Refactor initialization into a singular INIT state where both GPIO and DHT initialization are done, aligning with simpler FSM structures and simplifying error handling.\n\n2. **Improved Error and Recovery:**\n   - Introduce transitions and possibly retry mechanisms from the ERROR state, similar to what is seen in ref_FSMs, to recover from sensor reading failures.\n\n3. **Event-Based Actions Post Reading:**\n   - Implement event-based actions following the sensor read. Use condition checks (like temperature thresholds) to decide action states (e.g., controlling LEDs or posting events).\n\n4. **Match Actuation requirements:**\n   - Align the curr_code with the actuation patterns found in ref_FSMs\u2014introduce LED control logic as shown in reference FSMs, to trigger actions based on sensor data."
