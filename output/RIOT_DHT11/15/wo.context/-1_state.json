            "prefix: The problem seems to be related to how the `dht_init` function is being called in your RIOT operating system code for the ESP32. The current state of the code is causing issues because of incorrect argument types and possibly extra arguments. Based on the error messages, it looks like you are trying to initialize a DHT sensor on an ESP32 using the RIOT OS. The function `dht_init` is expecting a pointer for its arguments, but it's currently receiving an integer directly. The errors also suggest that too many arguments are being passed. To resolve these, you need to ensure that the function is called with the correct arguments based on its definition in the RIOT documentation. Additionally, the use of `xtimer_sleep` will help set the 5-second delay between readings. Moreover, network connection API calls that interact with external systems must be validated and handled using a while loop for retries. Once the connection is established, break out of the loop; otherwise, retry every second. Below is the corrected code to achieve this setup: \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"dht.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n\n#define DHT_PIN     GPIO_PIN(0, 2)\n#define SLEEP_TIME  (5U * US_PER_SEC)  // 5 seconds\n\ndht_t dev;\n\nint main(void) {\n    int16_t temp, hum;\n    int result;\n\n    // Initialize the DHT sensor\n    while (1) {\n        result = dht_init(&dev, DHT_PIN);\n        if (result != DHT_OK) {\n            printf(\"Failed to initialize DHT sensor. Retrying...\\n\");\n            xtimer_sleep(1);\n            continue;\n        } else {\n            printf(\"DHT sensor initialized successfully.\\n\");\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Main loop: Read every 5 seconds\n    while (1) {\n        result = dht_read(&dev, &temp, &hum);\n\n        if (result == DHT_OK) {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%dC, Humidity: %d.%d%%\\n\",\n                   temp / 10, temp % 10, hum / 10, hum % 10);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Failed to read from DHT sensor.\\n\");\n        }\n\n        xtimer_usleep(SLEEP_TIME);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
