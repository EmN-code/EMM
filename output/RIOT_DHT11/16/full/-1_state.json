            "prefix: The following RIOT code initializes a DHT11 sensor connected to GPIO2 on an ESP32 board and reads data from it every five seconds. The code uses the RIOT's DHT API for sensor communication and xtimer for timing. It checks and logs the outcomes of sensor initializations and readings. If reading the DHT sensor fails, it will print the error code. The program continuously loops, pausing for five seconds between each reading. Additionally, it handles initial DHT sensor setup and reads errors, demonstrating basic RIOT OS peripheral handling and timing functions. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <dht.h>\n#include \"dht_params.h\"\n\n#define DHT_PIN 2\n#define DHT_TYPE DHT11\n#define INTERVAL (5U * US_PER_SEC)\n\nint main(void) {\n    dht_t dev;\n    int16_t temp, hum;\n    int rc;\n\n    if ((rc = dht_init(&dev, &(dht_params_t){.pin = DHT_PIN, .type = DHT_TYPE})) != 0) {\n        printf(\"DHT initialization failed with code %d\\n\", rc);\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        if ((rc = dht_read(&dev, &temp, &hum)) != 0) {\n            printf(\"DHT read failed with code %d\\n\", rc);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d.%d%%\\n\", temp / 10, temp % 10, hum / 10, hum % 10);\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
