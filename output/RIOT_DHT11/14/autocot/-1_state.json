            "prefix: To create a program using RIOT OS for the ESP32 that reads the temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor connected to GPIO 2 every five seconds, we will use the DHT library for initialization and reading the data. The program will utilize the underlying functionalities provided by RIOT for managing time and delays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Import Required Headers**: We need to include headers for DHT sensor support, GPIO, and time management functions.\n2. **Define Main Functionality**: In the `main` function, initialize the DHT11 sensor with the specified GPIO pin and enter a loop where data is read every five seconds.\n3. **Reading Sensor**: Use the `dht_read` function to fetch the temperature and humidity values.\n4. **Output Results**: Print out the temperature and humidity values to standard output (e.g., console).\n5. **Utilize Sleep**: Utilize sleep or delay to wait for five seconds between each reading to consistently read data at desired intervals.\n\nBelow is the complete program to accomplish this task: \n block:  \n"
