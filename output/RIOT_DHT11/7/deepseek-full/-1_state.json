This element is missing in the `curr_FSMs`, where readings are handled directly in the main loop.\n\n- **Sleep Control:**\n  - The reference FSM uses `SLEEP` which indicates the use of `xtimer_usleep`, a more versatile timing function appropriate for precise control, whereas the current FSM uses `xtimer_sleep`, which is less precise.\n\n- **Error Handling:**\n  - The current FSM directly connects ERROR -> INIT, suggesting a retry. The reference FSM does not indicate a retry from ERROR; instead it appears to allow for handling within an isolated error state.\n\n\n**Corrective Measures for curr_code**\n1. **Implement Threading for DHT Sensor:**\n   - Create a dedicated thread for DHT sensor readings similar to the `DHT_THREAD_INIT` in the ref_FSM. This can help manage timing and sensor polling independently.\n\n2. **Modify Sleeping Function:**\n   - Replace `xtimer_sleep` with `xtimer_usleep` to improve timing precision and control, aligning with the `SLEEP` state of ref_FSM.\n\n3. **Refine Error Handling:**\n   - Develop a more robust error handling technique without immediately returning to the INIT state on error. Consider strategies to resolve errors within the error state like notifying other system components or logging the issue for diagnostic purposes.\n\n4. **Initialization Checks:**\n   - Before retrying INIT from ERROR, implement some checks or conditions to ensure the cause of the initialization failure has been resolved or is likely different on retry.\n\nBy adopting these recommendations, the system should better implement the desired logic defined in the reference FSM, increasing robustness and reliability in sensor polling and system behavior."
