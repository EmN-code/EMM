            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Analysis of Curr_FSMs and Ref_FSMs Patterns\n\n#### Curr_FSMs Pattern\n1. **INIT**\n   - If `RTC_INIT_OK`, transition to `SET_TIME`.\n   - If `RTC_INIT_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n2. **SET_TIME**\n   - If `SET_TIME_OK`, transition to `PREPARE_ALARM`.\n   - If `SET_TIME_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n3. **PREPARE_ALARM**\n   - If `ALARM_SET_OK`, transition to `WAIT_ALARM`.\n   - If `ALARM_SET_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n4. **WAIT_ALARM**\n   - If `ALARM_TRIGGERED`, transition to `HANDLE_ALARM`.\n\n5. **HANDLE_ALARM**\n   - If `ALARM_HANDLED`, transition to `WAIT_ALARM`.\n\n6. **ERROR**\n   - If `RETRY`, transition back to `INIT`.\n\n#### Ref_FSMs Pattern\n1. **INIT**\n   - If `rtc_init == RTC_OK`, transition to `SET_TIME`.\n   - If `rtc_init != RTC_OK`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n2. **SET_TIME**\n   - If `rtc_set_time == RTC_OK`, transition to `SET_ALARM`.\n   - If `rtc_set_time != RTC_OK`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n3. **SET_ALARM**\n   - If `rtc_set_alarm == RTC_OK`, transition to `WAIT_FOR_ALARM`.\n   - If `rtc_set_alarm != RTC_OK`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n4. **WAIT_FOR_ALARM**\n   - If `alarm_triggered`, transition to `ALARM_TRIGGERED`.\n\n5. **ALARM_TRIGGERED**\n   - If `msg_received`, transition to `END`.\n\n6. **ERROR**\n   - No transitions.\n\n7. **END**\n   - No transitions.\n\n\n### Differences and Issues Identified\n- **State Naming:** In the `curr_FSMs`, the state names do not exactly match with the `ref_FSMs`. For example, `SET_ALARM` in `ref_FSMs` is named `PREPARE_ALARM` in `curr_FSMs`.\n  \n- **Condition Matching:** The conditions have slightly different naming, but they refer to the same outcomes. `rtc_init == RTC_OK` and `RTC_INIT_OK` are equivalent, but the explicit referencing is more clear in the ref_FSMs.\n  \n- **State Transitions:** The `curr_FSMs` have additional error recovery with a `RETRY` condition that is not present in the `ref_FSMs`. `ref_FSMs` terminate in the `ERROR` state with no exit conditions, which could be more robust as it forces the error to be resolved before retrying.\n  \n- **Final State Handling:** The `ref_FSMs` include an `END` state after handling the alarm, while the `curr_FSMs` loop back to `WAIT_ALARM`.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n1. **Consistency in State Naming:** Align the state names between `curr_FSMs` and `ref_FSMs` for better clarity and maintenance.\n\n2. **Condition Representation:** Improve condition naming to explicitly correspond to the checks like `rtc_init == RTC_OK` in the `curr_FSMs` code.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** Consider removing the `RETRY` mechanism in favor of explicit error resolution before proceeding, matching the ref_FSMs pattern.\n\n4. **Final State Consideration:** Introduce a terminal state such as `END` in the `curr_FSMs` after handling the alarm, if applicable, to mark the end of the process.\n"

            "prefix: In this solution, we'll address the error by ensuring that the appropriate RTC functionality is correctly referenced and included. We will handle the RTC setup, setting the time, and configuring an alarm that will trigger a simple callback to print a message. This solution solves the error by using the correct imports and ensuring that the main functionality is placed within the main function, adhering to the RIOT OS framework. We'll design the code to set the RTC to a specific date and trigger an alarm after a delay, notifying the user with a print statement. We use the RTC API available in RIOT OS for the ESP32 platform specifically, which is included with the correct header files. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include <periph/rtc.h>\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg)\n{\n    (void)arg;  // Unused parameter\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    struct tm time;\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // tm_year is years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5;            // June (months since January 0-11)\n    time.tm_mday = 1;           // 1st\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n\n    if (rtc_set_time(&time) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to set time\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"Time set successfully\\n\");\n    }\n\n    struct tm alarm_time;\n    xtimer_sleep(5);  // Delay to set alarm\n    rtc_get_time(&alarm_time);  // Get current time\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5;  // Set alarm 5 seconds later\n\n    if (rtc_set_alarm(&alarm_time, alarm_callback, NULL) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to set alarm\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"Alarm set successfully\\n\");\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // To keep main running\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
