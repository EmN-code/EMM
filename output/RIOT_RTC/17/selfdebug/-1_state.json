Upon the alarm triggering, the message 'Alarm triggered!' should be printed. The solution involves utilizing the ztimer module in RIOT for the timing functionality, where 'ztimer_sleep' is used to simulate the delay of 5 seconds, triggering the alarm callback that prints the intended message. The header files needed for this operation are included in the correct order for proper compilation. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <ztimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <event/callback.h>\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Setting RTC alarm for 5 seconds from now...\\n\");\n    \n    ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_USEC, 5000000); // sleep for 5 seconds\n    alarm_callback(NULL);  // calling alarm callback\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
