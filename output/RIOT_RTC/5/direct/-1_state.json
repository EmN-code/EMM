            "prefix: To develop RIOT code that sets an RTC alarm on ESP32, initializing the RTC to a fixed date and then setting an alarm that triggers a callback, you follow these steps:\n1. Use the RTC peripheral to manipulate the real-time clock, ensuring to include necessary headers.\n2. Define a callback function `rtc_alarm_callback` to be called when the alarm triggers.\n3. In the `main` function, initialize the RTC and set a specific date (e.g., June 1, 2024).\n4. Configure the alarm to trigger after a certain duration (e.g., 5 seconds).\n5. Enter an infinite loop to keep the program running, allowing the RTC to manage the alarm timing.\n\nHere's the C code implementing this solution, ensuring proper header file inclusion and ordering. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"periph/rtc.h\"\n\nvoid rtc_alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Initializing RTC with alarm on an ESP32\\n\");\n\n    struct tm time;\n    struct tm alarm_time;\n    rtc_t rtc;\n\n    rtc_init();\n\n    // Set the current date and time to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    time.tm_year = 124;  // years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5;     // months since January [0-11]\n    time.tm_mday = 1;\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set the alarm time to 5 seconds after the current time\n    rtc_set_time(&alarm_time);\n\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5;\n\n    rtc_set_alarm(&alarm_time, rtc_alarm_callback, NULL);\n\n    printf(\"Alarm is set and the program is now running\\n\");\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
