Patterns Defined in curr_FSMs and ref_FSMs:**\n\n- **curr_FSMs Pattern**:\n  - INITIALIZE -> SET_TIME -> SET_ALARM -> WAIT -> ALARM_CALLBACK -> WAIT\n  - In case of error: Error can occur in initialization, time setting, alarm setting or waiting period leading to a rollback to INITIALIZE or halt.\n\n- **ref_FSMs Pattern**:\n  - INIT -> TIME_RETRIEVAL -> TIME_SET -> ALARM_SETUP -> MONITOR -> COMPLETE\n  - The process is similar, however TIME_RETRIEVAL step involves, and no retry mechanism is detailed post-error.\n\n\n**2. Differences and Potential Issues:**\n\n- **Initialization Step**:\n  - **curr_FSMs** uses \"INITIALIZE\" while **ref_FSMs** uses \"INIT\". For error conditions, the references suggest deep checking methods to exhaustively cover scenarios via \"rtc_init() == 0\", whereas curr_FSMs avoids that.\n  \n\n- **Time Retrieval**:\n  - **ref_FSMs** includes an explicit flag/state for Time Retrieval (\"TIME_RETRIEVAL\") and checks its success with \"RTC_GET_TIME_OK\", thus showing greater granularity. This is missed in curr_FSMs.\n  \n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - **curr_FSMs** exhibits a more intricate error path branching into either RETRY or HALT. Conversely, ref_FSMs ends the flow abruptly upon an error.\n\n- **Monitoring/Waiting**:\n  - **curr_FSMs** includes WAIT for the alarm, while **ref_FSMs** employs \"MONITOR\" and loops when conditions allow, going back into monitor mode or completion as needed.\n\n**Corrections**:\n\n1. **Add TIME_RETRIEVAL in curr_FSMs**:\n   - Insert an additional state after RTC Initialization for confirming time retrieval before setting it. Apply an error condition for retrieval failure as defined in ref_FSMs.\n\n2. **Explicit Error Checking**:\n   - Similar to ref_FSMs, conduct explicit checks (e.g., rtc_set_time() == 0) to determine state transitions for robustness, as opposed to general failure messages.\n\n3. **Simplify Error Handling**:\n   - Simplify error transitions in curr_FSMs to mirror ref_FSMs if consistency is preferred; direct transition to error with no retry outside `ERROR` state.\n\n4. **Shift to \"MONITOR\" Concept**:\n   - Transition \"WAIT\" state to a \"MONITOR\" concept. This state repeatedly checks, with a potential return to its loop upon conditions not directly leading to \"ALARM_TRIGGERED\" going to \"COMPLETE.\""
