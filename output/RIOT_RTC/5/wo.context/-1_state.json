For instance, implementing atomic state checks can improve reliability and robustness. This might involve verifying that timer set is valid using verification methods like those seen in ref_FSMs."

            "prefix: To set up an alarm on an ESP32 using RIOT OS, the following code snippet initializes the RTC time for June 1, 2024. It sets an alarm to trigger 5 seconds later.
