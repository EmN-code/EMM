            "prefix: To create a program for the ESP32 using RIOT OS that sets an RTC alarm, you need to follow several steps. First, you initialize the RTC with the desired date and time. In this example, we're setting the date to June 1, 2024. Then, you set an alarm to go off a specific amount of time later, in this case, 5 seconds after the set time. When the alarm triggers, a callback function is called, which in this implementation prints 'Alarm triggered!' to the console. Make sure to keep the program running in order to receive the alarm callback. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include \"rtc.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Define the RTC time as June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    struct tm time = {\n        .tm_year = 2024 - 1900,  // Year since 1900\n        .tm_mon = 5,            // June (MONTH is 0-11)\n        .tm_mday = 1,\n        .tm_hour = 0,\n        .tm_min = 0,\n        .tm_sec = 0,\n    };\n\n    // Initialize RTC and set the time\n    rtc_init();\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set an RTC alarm for 5 seconds later\n    time.tm_sec += 5;\n    rtc_set_alarm(&time, alarm_callback, NULL);\n\n    // Keep the program running\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
