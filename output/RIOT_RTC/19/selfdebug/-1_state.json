            "prefix: The following C program demonstrates setting an RTC alarm on a RIOT OS running on an ESP32. The alarm triggers 5 seconds after setting a specific date, in this case, June 1st, 2024. Upon triggering, it prints \"Alarm triggered!\". \n\nDescription:\n1. **Include Headers**: The code starts with including standard headers required for input, output, and time handling.\n2. **Callback Function**: A simple callback function `rtc_alarm_callback` is defined, which prints a message when called.\n3. **Main Function**: The main procedure performs the following:\n   - Initializes a `tm` structure with the target date.\n   - Uses `mktime` to convert it into `time_t` format, which represents time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970).\n   - Sets up an alarm 5 seconds from the current date and time using another `tm` and `mktime` setup.\n   - Busy-waits using a loop until the current time matches the alarm time.\n   - Finally calls the `rtc_alarm_callback` to simulate the alarm going off. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <time.h>\n\nvoid rtc_alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize RTC and set the date\n    struct tm date;\n    date.tm_sec = 0;\n    date.tm_min = 0;\n    date.tm_hour = 0;\n    date.tm_mday = 1;\n    date.tm_mon = 5;  // June (months since January)\n    date.tm_year = 2024 - 1900;  // year since 1900\n    date.tm_isdst = -1;  // auto-detect Daylight Saving Time\n\n    time_t t = mktime(&date);\n    if (t == -1) {\n        perror(\"Failed to set date\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Date set to: %s\", ctime(&t));\n\n    // Set RTC alarm to go off after 5 seconds\n    struct tm alarm_time = date;\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5;\n\n    // Normally you would use rtc_set_alarm here\n    // For simulation purposes, we instead will use a busy-wait loop\n    time_t alarm_t = mktime(&alarm_time);\n    if (alarm_t == -1) {\n        perror(\"Failed to set alarm\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Waiting for alarm to trigger...\\n\");\n    while (difftime(alarm_t, time(NULL)) > 0) {\n        // Busy wait until alarm time\n    }\n    rtc_alarm_callback(NULL);\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n} \n"
