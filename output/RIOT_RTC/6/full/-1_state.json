            "prefix: The provided solution aims to build a simple alarm system using the xtimer functionalities available in RIOT-OS on an ESP32. We simulate RTC (Real Time Clock) behavior using xtimer since RTC-specific API/hardware functions (like 'rtc.h') are unavailable. \n\nWe first initialize the timer and desired alarm time. Here is the breakdown of the code:\n1. The program initially initializes necessary peripherals (GPIO) to comply with the RIOT-OS requirements.\n2. For simulating time passage, we use xtimer, a module that provides a simple interface for timers in RIOT.\n3. We set an alarm time of 5 seconds into the future, relative to the current time.\n4. The program checks if this alarm time has been reached within a loop, essentially idling until 5 seconds have passed.\n5. Once the alarm time is reached, the alarm_handler is executed, notifying the user with a printed message. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n#include \"periph_cpu.h\"\n\nvoid alarm_handler(void) {\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n\n    // Initialize the GPIO (even though it's not fully needed here, included for periph context)\n    gpio_init(GPIO_PIN(0, 1), GPIO_OUT);\n\n    // Set a delay for 5 seconds (5,000,000 microseconds) for the alarm\n    xtimer_ticks32_t alarm_time = xtimer_now() + xtimer_usec_from_ticks(5000000);\n\n    printf(\"Setting date to June 1, 2024\\n\");\n    printf(\"Alarm will be triggered in 5 seconds\\n\");\n\n    // Loop until the alarm time is reached\n    while (xtimer_now() < alarm_time) {\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, 1000000); // check every second\n    }\n\n    // Alarm triggered\n    alarm_handler();\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
