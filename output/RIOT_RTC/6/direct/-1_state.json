            "prefix: In this code, we will be implementing a simple application for the ESP32 using RIOT OS to set and trigger an RTC alarm. The code does the following:\n\n1. First, we include the necessary header files: `xtimer` for sleep functions, and `periph/rtc` for working with the RTC (Real Time Clock) peripheral.\n\n2. We define a callback function `rtc_alarm_cb` that will trigger when the RTC alarm goes off. In this case, it prints \"Alarm triggered!\".\n\n3. Inside `main`, we initialize and set the RTC date and time to June 1, 2024, assigning the seconds, minutes, and hours to zero.\n\n4. We set a sleep delay of 5 seconds using `xtimer_sleep` which is used here to represent the delay before setting the alarm.\n\n5. After sleeping for 5 seconds, we update the RTC alarm time to trigger 5 seconds from the current RTC time, defining the callback `rtc_alarm_cb` to be executed when the alarm fires.\n\n6. An infinite idle loop keeps the program running, allowing the RTC alarm to eventually trigger. This example assumes the presence of required dependencies and libraries in RIOT's build environment for ESP32. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/rtc.h>\n\nvoid rtc_alarm_cb(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"RTC Alarm example on ESP32\\n\");\n\n    struct tm time;\n    rtc_get_time(&time);\n\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5; // months since January [0-11]\n    time.tm_mday = 1; // day of the month [1-31]\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n\n    if (rtc_set_time(&time) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to set RTC time\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Current time set to: %d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d\\n\",\n           1900 + time.tm_year, time.tm_mon, time.tm_mday, time.tm_hour, time.tm_min, time.tm_sec);\n\n    xtimer_sleep(5); // simulate delay before setting the alarm\n\n    rtc_get_time(&time);\n    time.tm_sec += 5; // set alarm to 5 seconds from now\n\n    if (rtc_set_alarm(&time, rtc_alarm_cb, NULL) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to set RTC alarm\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Alarm set for 5 seconds later\\n\");\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Idle loop\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
