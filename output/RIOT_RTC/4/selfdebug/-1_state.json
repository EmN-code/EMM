            "prefix: The error message indicates that the 'mosfet/rtc.h' header file is not found during compilation. This typically means that the file path specified in the includes is incorrect or the library for RTC is not correctly linked in the build system. To solve this issue, we need to ensure that we're including the correct RTC library that is available in the RIOT OS system for the ESP32 platform. \n\nApproach:\n1. Verify that we're including the correct RTC-related headers from RIOT. Typically, for RTC functionalities, relevant peripheral headers or drivers should be used.\n2. Set the date and time for the RTC, then configure the alarm to trigger after 5 seconds.\n3. Implement an ISR or callback to handle the alarm interrupt and print \"Alarm triggered!\".\n\nHere is a corrected and complete example implementation for setting an RTC alarm on an ESP32 using RIOT OS: \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/rtc.h>\n\n// Callback function for the RTC alarm\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct tm time;\n    struct tm alarm_time;\n\n    // Set the RTC time to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // Year since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 6 - 1;        // Months since January\n    time.tm_mday = 1;           // Day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n\n    if (rtc_set_time(&time) < 0) {\n        printf(\"Error setting the RTC time\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"RTC time set to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\\n\");\n\n    // Set the alarm to trigger after 5 seconds\n    xtimer_sleep(5);\n    rtc_get_time(&alarm_time);\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5; // Add 5 seconds to the current time\n\n    if (rtc_set_alarm(&alarm_time, alarm_callback, NULL) < 0) {\n        printf(\"Error setting the RTC alarm\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Main loop can perform other tasks\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
