            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: # Error Analysis of the Current Code Based on FSMs\n\n## Overview\nThe current code attempts to implement an FSM for RTC alarm configuration and handling. However, it deviates from the expected FSM patterns provided in the reference FSMs, leading to potential issues in robustness and error handling.\n\n## Identified Patterns in FSMs\n### Current FSM\n1. **INIT** \n   - RTC_INIT_OK -> ALARM_SET\n   - RTC_INIT_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n2. **ALARM_SET**\n   - ALARM_TIME_REACHED -> ALARM_TRIGGERED\n\n3. **ALARM_TRIGGERED**\n   - ALARM_CLEARED -> ALARM_SET\n\n4. **ERROR**\n   - ERROR_RESOLVED -> INIT\n\n### Reference FSMs\n#### Ref FSM #1\n1. **INIT**\n   - RTC_INIT_OK -> SET_TIME\n   - RTC_INIT_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n2. **SET_TIME**\n   - SET_TIME_OK -> PREPARE_ALARM\n   - SET_TIME_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n3. **PREPARE_ALARM**\n   - ALARM_SET_OK -> WAIT_ALARM\n   - ALARM_SET_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n4. **WAIT_ALARM**\n   - ALARM_TRIGGERED -> HANDLE_ALARM\n\n5. **HANDLE_ALARM**\n   - ALARM_HANDLED -> WAIT_ALARM\n\n6. **ERROR**\n   - RETRY -> INIT\n\n#### Ref FSM #2\n1. **INIT**\n   - RTC_INIT_OK -> TIME_RETRIEVAL\n   - RTC_INIT_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n2. **TIME_RETRIEVAL**\n   - RTC_GET_TIME_OK -> TIME_SET\n   - RTC_GET_TIME_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n3. **TIME_SET**\n   - RTC_SET_TIME_OK -> ALARM_SETUP\n   - RTC_SET_TIME_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n4. **ALARM_SETUP**\n   - RTC_SET_ALARM_OK -> MONITOR\n   - RTC_SET_ALARM_FAIL -> ERROR\n\n5. **MONITOR**\n   - ALARM_TRIGGERED -> COMPLETE\n   - MUTEX_LOCK_FAIL -> ERROR\n   - REPEAT -> MONITOR\n   \n## Differences and Incorrect Matches\n1. **Missing States and Transitions**: The current FSM directly transitions from `INIT` to `ALARM_SET`, skipping crucial intermediary steps such as setting the time and preparing the alarm (`SET_TIME` and `PREPARE_ALARM`). This differs from both reference FSMs.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The error handling is less detailed in the current FSM. The reference FSMs provide specific paths for errors encountered during setting the time or preparing the alarm.\n\n3. **Handling after Alarm is Triggered**: The current FSM only cycles between `ALARM_TRIGGERED` and `ALARM_SET`, missing a dedicated `HANDLE_ALARM` or `COMPLETE` state after an alarm-triggered event is managed.\n\n## Corrective Measures\n1. **Expand INIT Transition**: After successful RTC initialization (`RTC_INIT_OK`), transition to a `SET_TIME` state where the device time is set.\n2. **Add Error Transitions After Each Critical Step**: If time setting or alarm preparation fails, transition to an `ERROR` state.\n3. **Introduce Intermediate States**: Incorporate `SET_TIME`, `PREPARE_ALARM`, and `WAIT_ALARM` or analogous states to handle transitions more robustly.\n4. **Enhance Alarm Handling**: After an alarm is triggered, transition to a `HANDLE_ALARM` state before returning to `WAIT_ALARM`, ensuring that the alarm condition is adequately addressed before rearming."

            "prefix: The error indicates that the header file 'esp_idf_rtc_gpio_pullup_en.h' is missing. To resolve this, ensure that you have the correct path to the ESP32 IDF environment and that this header is included if required. However, for setting an RTC alarm on an ESP32 using RIOT-OS, a different approach can be adopted. We will use the RTC functionalities available in RIOT to implement this feature, setting the date and time, and triggering an alarm after 5 seconds. Here's the modified code solution for achieving RTC alarm in RIOT on an ESP32: \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include \"periph/rtc.h\"\n\nvoid rtc_alarm_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct tm time;\n    rtc_init();\n\n    // Set the date to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    time.tm_year = 2024; // Year\n    time.tm_mon = 5;    // Month 0-11\n    time.tm_mday = 1;   // Day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set an alarm 5 seconds later\n    xtimer_sleep(5);\n\n    // Retrieve current time and add 5 seconds\n    rtc_get_time(&time);\n    time.tm_sec += 5; // Add 5 seconds\n\n    // Set the RTC alarm to trigger after 5 seconds\n    rtc_set_alarm(&time, rtc_alarm_handler, NULL);\n\n    while (1) { \n        // Keeping the main function running\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
