            "prefix: The program for the ESP32 using RIOT OS is designed to set up an alarm system using the RTC (Real-Time Clock) functionality. It sets the date to June 1, 2024, and triggers an alarm after 5 seconds, printing \"Alarm triggered!\" upon activation. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:\n\n1. **Includes**: The necessary libraries are included for handling I/O operations, time functions, and the ztimer for scheduling tasks in RIOT.\n2. **Alarm Callback Function**: This is a simple function that prints a message \"Alarm triggered!\" when called.\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - The `struct tm` is used to define the date and time details, setting them to June 1, 2024.\n   - `mktime` converts this `struct tm` to a `time_t` format to get a timestamp for the future date.\n   - The current time is fetched using `time()`, and the difference in seconds to the future time is calculated.\n   - If this future time is detected to be in the past (as the test environment might not be beyond 2024), it adjusts to set an alarm 5 seconds from the current time.\n   - The `ztimer_sleep` function schedules the delay for the alarm in microseconds.\n   - Finally, the alarm callback function is called after the delay, printing the message. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"ztimer.h\"\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void) {\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Define time structure and set the date to June 1, 2024\n    struct tm set_time;\n    set_time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // Year since 1900\n    set_time.tm_mon = 6 - 1;        // Month, 0-11\n    set_time.tm_mday = 1;           // Day of the month\n    set_time.tm_hour = 0;           // Hour since midnight\n    set_time.tm_min = 0;            // Minutes after the hour\n    set_time.tm_sec = 0;            // Seconds after the minute\n    set_time.tm_isdst = -1;         // No daylight saving time\n\n    // Convert struct tm to time_t\n    time_t future_time = mktime(&set_time);\n\n    // Calculate current time\n    time_t current_time;\n    time(&current_time);\n\n    // Calculate difference in seconds from current time\n    double seconds_to_wait = difftime(future_time, current_time);\n\n    // If the set time is in the past, adjust it for the next cycle\n    if (seconds_to_wait < 0) {\n        printf(\"Specified time is in the past. Adjusting for the next cycle.\\n\");\n        future_time = current_time + 5; // Set alarm 5 seconds from now\n    }\n\n    // Trigger alarm 5 seconds after the specified time\n    ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_USEC, (seconds_to_wait + 5) * 1000000U);\n    alarm_callback();\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
