To solve this, we need to ensure that the correct header file for RTC functionality in RIOT is included. According to the documentation, we need to use RIOT's RTC interface. The following code sets the RTC date to June 1, 2024, and triggers an alarm after 5 seconds to print 'Alarm triggered!'. The implementation assumes the availability of corresponding RTC functions provided by RIOT.
