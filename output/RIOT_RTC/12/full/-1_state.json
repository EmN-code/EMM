The code must include extensive exception handling.\nFor example:\n```c\nif (NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT) != 0) {\n    return \"Network connection failed.\";\n}\n    ```\nshould be changed to\n```c\nWhile (1) {\n    rc = NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT)\n    # Since NetworkConnect interacts with external system, we should check the rc. reconnect or exception handling\n    if(rc!=0){\n        printf(\"connect failed\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1)\n        contine;\n    }else{\n        printf(\"connect successfully\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```"
