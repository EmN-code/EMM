            "prefix: To develop a RIOT application on an ESP32 that sets an RTC alarm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the RTC module:** This involves calling the `rtc_init()` function to ensure the RTC is ready to use.\n\n2. **Set the Date and Time:** We construct a `struct tm` with the desired date. For June 1, 2024, the `tm_year` should be set to `2024 - 1900`, `tm_mon` to `5` (since it is zero-based where January is 0), and `tm_mday` to `1`. The hours, minutes, and seconds are set to `0` for this use case.\n\n3. **Set the Alarm:** A new `struct tm` is created, adding 5 seconds to the `tm_sec` field of the base time. The `rtc_set_alarm()` function uses this alarm time and triggers a callback function when the alarm activates.\n\n4. **Callback Function:** The `alarm_callback()` function is defined to print \"Alarm triggered!\" to the console when the alarm goes off.\n\n5. **Loop to Keep Program Running:** We use an infinite loop with a short `xtimer_sleep()` interval to keep the program running and waiting for the alarm to trigger.\n\nBy using the provided RIOT functions and setting up the RTC with a callback, the alarm is successfully integrated. The example relies on fictive RTC and XTIMER APIs extracted from the documentation snippet. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <rtc.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n\nstatic void alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;  // Unused parameter\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize RTC\n    rtc_init();\n\n    // Set RTC time to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    struct tm time;\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900;  // Years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5;             // Month, starting from 0 (June is 5)\n    time.tm_mday = 1;            // Day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set RTC alarm 5 seconds later\n    struct tm alarm_time = time;\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5;\n    rtc_set_alarm(&alarm_time, alarm_callback, NULL);\n\n    // Keep the program running to wait for the alarm\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(10);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
