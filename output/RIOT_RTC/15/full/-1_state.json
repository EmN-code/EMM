            "prefix: To develop a RIOT application on ESP32 with RTC alarms, we first need to address several errors from previous attempts. The errors are commonly due to the improper use of functions or undeclared variables and functions. We will use the RTC peripheral API provided by RIOT to handle real-time clock operations and configure alarms. Since handling the RTC involves asynchronous events like alarms, we must define callback functions and ensure the date and time are correctly set.\n\nHere's a structured solution:\n1. **Include necessary headers**: We will include `periph/rtc.h`, `periph/gpio.h`, and `periph/i2c.h` for RTC and peripheral controls, ensuring we have access to necessary hardware interfaces.\n\n2. **Setup RTC time**: Initialize the RTC to the desired date (June 1, 2024) using appropriate structures and functions from `periph/rtc.h`.\n\n3. **RTC Alarm Configuration**: Set an RTC alarm for 5 seconds in the future, providing a callback function to handle the alarm event.\n\n4. **Callback function**: Define what should happen when an alarm goes off, such as printing \"Alarm triggered!\"\n\n5. **Error checking and handling**: Incorporate error checking when setting the time and alarms, with logic in place for retries as needed.\n\nBelow is the complete code implementation. \n block: #include \"periph/rtc.h\"\n#include \"periph/i2c.h\"\n#include \"periph/gpio.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Callback function for RTC alarm\nvoid alarm_cb(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct tm time;\n    struct tm alarm_time;\n    int rc;\n\n    // Initialize RTC time to June 1, 2024\n    // Ensure that the time is appropriately set\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900;  // Year since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 6 - 1;         // Month, where 0 = January\n    time.tm_mday = 1;            // Day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n\n    // Set the RTC time with retry logic\n    while (1) {\n        rc = rtc_set_time(&time);\n        if (rc != 0) {\n            printf(\"Failed to set RTC time.
