The code must include extensive exception handling.\nFor example:\n```c\nif (NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT) != 0) {\n    return \"Network connection failed.\";\n}\n    ```\nshould be changed to\n```c\nWhile (1) {\n    rc = NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT)\n    # Since NetworkConnect interacts with external system, we should check the rc. reconnect or exception handling\n    if(rc!=0){\n        printf(\"connect failed\");\n        xtimer_sleep(1)\n        contine;\n    }else{\n        printf(\"connect successfully\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```"

To solve this, ensure that the RIOT environment is correctly set up and that the necessary modules are included in the Makefile. This file enables RTC functionalities in RIOT for ESP32. Also, remember to utilize the xtimer module for delays.\n\nIn the following solution, I include the correct header file for RTC, make use of callback functions, and handle potential errors while setting the RTC date and alarm.
