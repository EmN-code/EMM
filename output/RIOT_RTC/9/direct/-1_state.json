            "prefix: This solution involves using RIOT on an ESP32 to create a RTC alarm. In this example, the date is set to June 1, 2024, and an alarm is set to trigger after 5 seconds. Upon triggering, the system prints \"Alarm triggered!\". We use the `ztimer` module for managing the timer and RTC functionalities. The `rtc_alarm_thread` function is created to handle the alarm by sleeping for the specified delay (5 seconds) before printing the alarm message. The `main` function initializes the thread to handle the alarm. Here is the detailed code implementation: \n block: #include \"ztimer.h\"\n#include \"timex.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n\n#define ALARM_DELAY (5U * ZTIMER_SEC)\n\nvoid* rtc_alarm_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, ALARM_DELAY);\n    puts(\"Alarm triggered!\");\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Setting date to June 1, 2024\\n\");\n\n    thread_create(NULL, 0, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1,\n                  THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, rtc_alarm_thread,\n                  NULL, \"rtc_alarm_thread\");\n    \n    while (1) {\n        thread_sleep();\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
