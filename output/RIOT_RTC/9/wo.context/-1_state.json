This typically occurs when a function call which doesn't return a value is used in a context where a value is expected. In this specific context, we will ensure that the function calls that are expected to return a value are properly utilized. Based on the scenario, the following code sets an ESP32's RTC to June 1, 2024, and triggers an alarm after 5 seconds. The program prints 'Alarm triggered!' when the alarm goes off.
