To handle RTC functionality on the ESP32 platform in RIOT, we should use the appropriate peripheral libraries provided by RIOT for the ESP32. Normally, the RTC (Real-Time Clock) functionalities may not be directly available as a single header file and might need utilizing other native capabilities or abstracted interface in RIOT. Here, we'll illustrate setting an RTC alarm by using the relevant API available for date and time management in RIOT. This example initializes an RTC and sets an alarm for 5 seconds in the future from a specific starting date.\n\nImports required for the RIOT and ESP32 setup should be included carefully, ensuring no use of non-existing files.\n\nLet's see the complete code structure below. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <inttypes.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct tm timeinfo;\n    timeinfo.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // Year since 1900\n    timeinfo.tm_mon = 6 - 1;        // Month, where 0 = January\n    timeinfo.tm_mday = 1;           // Day of the month\n    timeinfo.tm_hour = 0;\n    timeinfo.tm_min = 0;\n    timeinfo.tm_sec = 0;\n    timeinfo.tm_isdst = -1;         // Is DST on? 1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = unknown\n\n    time_t start_time = mktime(&timeinfo);\n    if (start_time == -1) {\n        printf(\"Failed to create the time structure\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    printf(\"Current date is June 1, 2024\\n\");\n\n    // Set an alarm 5 seconds after the start date\n    time_t alarm_time = start_time + 5;\n\n    while (time(NULL) < alarm_time) {\n        // Busy-waiting if running without deeper hardware RTC capabilities\n        // In a real-world example, this should be handled by sleep functions\n    }\n\n    // Trigger the alarm callback function\n    alarm_callback(NULL);\n    return 0;\n} \n"
