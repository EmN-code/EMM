            "prefix: The following code is designed for the ESP32 using the RIOT operating system to achieve an RTC alarm function. The main task is to set the date to June 1, 2024, and then trigger an alarm after 5 seconds. When the alarm is triggered, the system prints \"Alarm triggered!\" to the console. Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n- RIOT's peripheral RTC API is used to interface with the RTC hardware.\n- The RTC is initialized at the beginning of the program. If initialization fails, an error message is printed.\n- The RTC time is set to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00 by configuring a `struct tm` with the corresponding date and time values.\n- An alarm is set to trigger after 5 seconds by simply incrementing the `tm_sec` field by 5.\n- A loop checks periodically (every second) if the alarm has been triggered using `rtc_alarm_check`. When the alarm is detected, \"Alarm triggered!\" is printed, and the loop exits.\n\nNecessary header files are included in descending alphabetical order. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <periph/rtc.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the RTC\n    if (rtc_init() != 0) {\n        printf(\"RTC initialization failed\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Set the RTC time to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    struct tm time;\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 6 - 1;        // months since January, 0-11\n    time.tm_mday = 1;           // day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set RTC alarm for 5 seconds later\n    time.tm_sec += 5;\n    rtc_set_alarm(&time);\n\n    // Wait and check for the alarm trigger in a loop\n    while (1) {\n        if (rtc_alarm_check()) {\n            printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n            break;\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(1); // Sleep for 1 second\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
