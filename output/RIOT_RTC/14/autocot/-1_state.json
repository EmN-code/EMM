            "prefix: To develop a RIOT application on an ESP32 that sets an RTC alarm for June 1, 2024, which triggers 5 seconds later, we can follow a structured approach:\n\n1. Include necessary headers: For RTC functionality and timing operations in RIOT, we include headers for RTC and timer utility functions in alphabetical order.\n\n2. Define an alarm callback function: This function will execute when the RTC alarm triggers, printing \"Alarm triggered!\".\n\n3. In the main function:\n   - Define a `struct tm` for the calendar date and an `rtc_alarm_t` for the alarm settings.\n   - Set the initial RTC time to June 1, 2024.\n   - Adjust the current time to be 5 seconds later to set the alarm.\n   - Register the alarm with the RTC using `rtc_set_alarm`, passing in the callback.\n   - Use a delay (`xtimer_sleep`) to keep the application running long enough for the alarm to activate.\n\nThis code initializes the RTC, sets the current time, schedules an alarm in 5 seconds, and waits to output a message when the alarm is triggered. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include \"rtc.h\"\n#include <xtimer.h>\n\n/* RTC Alarm Callback Function */\nvoid rtc_alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg; // Avoid unused variable warning\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct tm time;\n    rtc_alarm_t alarm;\n\n    /* Set the date to June 1, 2024 */\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900; // Year since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5;  // Month: June = 5 (0-indexed, i.e., January = 0)\n    time.tm_mday = 1; // Day of the month\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    /* Get the current RTC time */\n    rtc_get_time(&time);\n\n    /* Set alarm to trigger after 5 seconds */\n    time.tm_sec += 5;\n    mktime(&time); // Normalize time structure\n    alarm.time = time;\n    alarm.cb = rtc_alarm_callback;\n    alarm.arg = NULL;\n\n    /* Set the RTC alarm */\n    if (rtc_set_alarm(&alarm) != 0) {\n        printf(\"Failed to set RTC alarm\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    /* Wait for the alarm */\n    xtimer_sleep(10); // Sleep long enough to ensure alarm triggers\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
