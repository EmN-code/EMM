            "prefix: This solution demonstrates how to use the RIOT operating system to set an RTC (Real-Time Clock) alarm on an ESP32 device. The code sets the RTC date to June 1, 2024, and schedules an alarm to trigger after 5 seconds. When the alarm is triggered, the callback function prints \"Alarm triggered!\".\n\nFirst, we include necessary headers for printf, RTC operations, time expression handling, and ztimer for sleep.\n\nThe `alarm_callback` function is defined to handle the RTC alarm event and print a message.\n\nIn the main function, the RTC is initialized, and the time is set using a `struct tm` to June 1, 2024. An alarm is set to trigger 5 seconds from the current time and the program enters an infinite loop to keep it running. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <rtc.h>\n#include <timex.h>\n#include <ztimer.h>\n\nvoid alarm_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;  // Avoid unused warning\n    printf(\"Alarm triggered!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize the RTC\n    rtc_init();\n\n    // Set the current date and time to June 1, 2024, 00:00:00\n    struct tm time;\n    time.tm_year = 2024 - 1900;  // Years since 1900\n    time.tm_mon = 5;             // Months since January (0-11)\n    time.tm_mday = 1;            // Day of the month (1-31)\n    time.tm_hour = 0;\n    time.tm_min = 0;\n    time.tm_sec = 0;\n    rtc_set_time(&time);\n\n    // Set the alarm to trigger 5 seconds from the current time\n    struct tm alarm_time = time;\n    alarm_time.tm_sec += 5;\n    rtc_set_alarm(&alarm_time, alarm_callback, NULL);\n\n    // Wait here to prevent the program from exiting\n    while (1) {\n        ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, 1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
