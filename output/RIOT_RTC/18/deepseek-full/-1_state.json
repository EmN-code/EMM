            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: After analyzing the FSM patterns and the code, here are a few discrepancies and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **State Transition Naming Conventions**: The curr_FSMs uses state names and transitions like \"SET_TIME\" and \"TIME_SET_OK\", while the ref_FSMs use \"SET_DATE\" and \"DATE_SET_OK\". Both should agree on naming conventions for clarity.\n\n2. **Alarm Triggering State**:\n   - In curr_FSMs, there is a transition \"WAIT_FOR_ALARM\" to \"ALARM\" with condition \"ALARM_TRIGGERED\". In the ref_FSMs, the name for this state is \"ALARM_TRIGGERED_STATE\". Again, for consistency and maintainability, it's better to use uniform naming for identical states.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - The curr_FSMs have a pathway for acknowledging alarms \"ACKNOWLEDGE_ALARM\" which could directly reset alarm setting without resolving the root issue. Ref FSM suggests a more robust approach by handling errors (\"HANDLE_ERROR\") before transitioning back to initial states.\n\n4. **Missing Network Logic in curr_FSMs**:\n   - In curr_FSMs, there is a \"NETWORK_RECONNECT\" state, which is not reflected in the ref_FSMs. This indicates an absence of network failure management in reference FSMs, perhaps suggesting a need to decide if this is essential or extraneous functionality.\n\n5. **Failure Conditions**:\n   - The ref_FSMs include conditions for potential failures more clearly, such as 'RTC_FAIL' during waiting for the alarm in \"WAIT_ALARM\", while the curr_FSMs currently lack any fail-safe checks during \"WAIT_FOR_ALARM\".\n\n6. **Corrective Measures**:\n   - Adopt consistent naming conventions across all FSM states and transitions between different FSMs.\n   - Implement comprehensive error handling following the reference pattern for robustness.\n   - Explicitly define and handle network-related conditions if necessary.\n   - Introduce missing fail-safe checks such as for RTC failures during waiting for alarms.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the FSM and application code can be improved for better clarity, resilience in handling errors, and maintainability."
