### Pattern Matching and Differences Analysis

#### Current FSM Pattern
1. `INIT` (RTC_INIT_OK) -> `SET_DATE`
2. `SET_DATE` (RTC_SET_TIME_OK) -> `GET_CURRENT_TIME`
3. `GET_CURRENT_TIME` (RTC_GET_TIME_OK) -> `SET_ALARM`
4. `SET_ALARM` (RTC_SET_ALARM_OK) -> `WAIT_FOR_ALARM`
5. `WAIT_FOR_ALARM` (ALARM_TRIGGERED) -> `ALARM_CALLBACK`
6. `ALARM_CALLBACK` (CALLBACK_COMPLETE) -> `WAIT_FOR_ALARM`
7. `ERROR` (RETRY) -> `INIT`

#### Reference FSM Pattern
1. `INIT` (RTC_INIT_OK) -> `TIME_RETRIEVAL`
2. `TIME_RETRIEVAL` (RTC_GET_TIME_OK) -> `TIME_SET`
3. `TIME_SET` (RTC_SET_TIME_OK) -> `ALARM_SETUP`
4. `ALARM_SETUP` (RTC_SET_ALARM_OK) -> `MONITOR`
5. `MONITOR` (ALARM_TRIGGERED) -> `COMPLETE`
6. `ERROR` (no retry specified, finite state)

#### Differences and Issues
1. **Sequence Misalignment:**
   - In the current FSM, `SET_DATE` comes before `GET_CURRENT_TIME`. This sequence is unnecessary as RTC time should be retrieved before setting it.
   - In the reference FSM, the retrieval is first, which matches logical steps of ensuring time is correctly read before setting or changing.
2. **State Redundancy:**
   - The current FSM moves from `WAIT_FOR_ALARM` back to itself after the callback with `CALLBACK_COMPLETE`. This is redundant as per the reference FSM where `MONITOR` directly ends with `COMPLETE` post-trigger.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - The current FSM has the ability to retry from `ERROR`, unlike the reference FSM.
   - A retry mechanism is useful, indicating need for redesigning `ERROR` handling since the reference FSM presumes finite transitions for `ERROR`.

### Corrective Measures
1. **Align Logic Sequence:**
   - Adjust the sequence between `SET_DATE` and `GET_CURRENT_TIME` to follow the reference FSM.
   - Refactor the flow to: Initiate with time retrieval (`TIME_RETRIEVAL`), followed by setting the desired time (`TIME_SET`).
2. **Simplify Alarm Handling:**
   - Simplify the post-alarm triggered state by merging `WAIT_FOR_ALARM` and transition from `ALARM_CALLBACK` to finalize with a `COMPLETE` state.
3. **Enhance Error Handling:**
   - Review the retry mechanism and evaluate for redundancy or necessity in error correction methods, ideally refining to exit gracefully post a failure with optional retry based on design needs.
