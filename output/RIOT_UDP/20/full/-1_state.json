            "prefix: The error message indicates that the function `inet_pton` is implicitly declared, which implies that the appropriate header file for its declaration has not been included. The function `inet_pton` is declared in the `<arpa/inet.h>` header file. To resolve this issue, we should ensure that this header file is included in the example program. Also, I will incorporate logic to ensure that network connection retries are handled and the state is sent every 5 seconds using the xtimer module for delays. The program will create a UDP socket, configure it with the remote server's address, and use a loop to send device states (\"work\" or \"not work\"), implementing robust error handling strategies.
