            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Incorrect Pattern Matching and Logical Errors in Current Code:\n\n#### 1. **Error Handling in Socket Creation and State Sending:**\n- **Current FSM Pattern (curr_FSMs):**\n  - On socket creation failure or send failure, transitions to the `ERROR` state.\n  - From `ERROR`, there is only a `RECOVER` transition back to `CREATE_SOCKET`.\n\n- **Reference FSM Pattern (ref_FSMs):**\n  - Similar transition to an `ERROR` state for both socket creation and send failures.\n  - More robust mechanisms for resolving errors and retrying, transitioning back to `UDP_CLIENT_START` after resolution.\n\n- **Analysis:** \n  - In the current code, the error handling mechanism isn't robust enough. It fails to describe how errors are resolved. It simply transitions back to the socket creation or never explicitly retries sending the state once errors are encountered.\n  \n#### 2. **Waiting Mechanism and State Transition: WAIT in curr_FSMs vs WAIT_INTERVAL in ref_FSMs**\n- **Current FSM Pattern:**\n  - After successful send and close, waits using a timer (`WAIT` state) before returning to `CREATE_SOCKET`.\n \n- **Reference FSM Pattern:**\n  - Has a `WAIT_INTERVAL` state post-send, which transitions back to `SEND_DEVICE_STATE` after the interval.\n\n- **Analysis:** \n  - There\u2019s a lack of clarity in the current FSM on the mechanism of error recovery during the wait state. The reference FSM clearly delineates a complete return to the sending state instead of recreating the socket every time.\n\n#### 3. **Startup and Initialization Procedures:**\n- **Current FSM Pattern:**\n  - Starts from an `INIT` state that directly progresses to IP parsing.\n\n- **Reference FSM Pattern:**\n  - Begins with a `START` state for broader initialization, before moving into `UDP_CLIENT_START`, akin to specific sub-process initiations.\n\n- **Analysis:** \n  - The current code jumps directly into network setup once IP parsing is successful, skipping steps that may be crucial for complete initialization.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Implement Robust Error Handling:**\n   - Introduce detailed error recovery strategies in the `ERROR` state to resolve issues and enable retries.\n   - Add more clear transitions from `ERROR` back to a more general start state similar to the `UDP_CLIENT_START` of ref_FSMs once recovery is deemed successful.\n\n2. **Consistent Wait and Retry Logic:**\n   - Modify the logic so that after a successful send, the system waits and then directly attempts to resend after the interval, instead of fully resetting the connection unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Expand Initialization Procedures:**\n   - Consider a preliminary initialization phase, similar to `START`, to set up necessary resources or environmental checks before proceeding with socket creation or network communications. This might include network interface checking or device preliminary setup."
