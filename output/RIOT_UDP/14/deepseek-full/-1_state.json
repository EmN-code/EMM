            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: The patterns extracted from both curr_FSMs and ref_FSMs reveal some key differences:\n\n1. **Initialization and Error Handling**:\n   - The curr_FSMs and ref_FSMs both start with an initialization state that transitions into a state related to socket creation (CREATE_SOCKET in curr_FSMs and UDP_CLIENT_START in ref_FSMs). However, the ref_FSMs start from a 'START' state which might involve additional setup not shown in curr_FSMs.\n   - Error handling differs; curr_FMS goes to an \"ERROR\" state upon any fault (socket creation or message sending) with generic \"RETRY\" logic, while ref_FSMs have more descriptive error recovery (`error_resolved` targeting UDP_CLIENT_START) without unclear retry attempts.\n\n2. **Messaging and Transition to Wait State:**\n   - The states in curr_FSMs use conditions like `SOCKET_CREATION_SUCCESS` and `MESSAGE_SENT_SUCCESS`, transitioning to \"WAIT\" where a `TIMEOUT` condition transitions back. In ref_FSMs, similar transitions utilize names such as `send_success` leading to \"WAIT_INTERVAL\" that transitions back to \"SEND_DEVICE_STATE\" upon `interval_elapsed`.\n   \n3. **Interval and Socket Handling**:\n   - curr_FSM's \"WAIT\" state transitions back to socket creation after a timeout, which mimics a periodic message sending cycle.\n   - ref_FSM emphasizes message sending continuity by revisiting \"SEND_DEVICE_STATE\". This makes clearer distinctions between socket creation failure/restart and message sending cycles.\n\n**Issues Identified in curr_code**:\n- Lack of detailed error resolution strategies. The program generic retry upon errors may cause endless loops upon persistent errors.\n- After each message send attempt, re-creates sockets regardless of success or failure which could be inefficient in network resource usage.\n\n**Corrective Measures**:\n- Enhance error handling to specifically address socket and message failures, possibly with retry limits or error logging. Consider \"error_resolved\" strategies from ref_FSMs.\n- Maintain socket persistence across message sends if possible, only recreate on actual failures to resource efficiency, aligning more with a continuous send cycle model seen in \"WAIT_INTERVAL\" state in ref_FSMs.\n  \n- Implement a more refined \"interval_elapsed\" approach where message sending timing is governed by a consistent cycle mechanism, rather than total socket recreation if no error occurred previously."
