            "prefix: In this solution, we will develop a RIOT application for the ESP32 that periodically sends the device's state over UDP to a specified server. The device will connect to a UDP server at IP `47.102.103.1` on port `20001` and will send the state message \"work\" or \"not work\" every five seconds. We'll utilize RIOT's networking capabilities to achieve this. \n\n### Steps Involved:\n1. Initialize the UDP connection using RIOT's `udp_connect` function.\n2. Implement a loop that runs every five seconds to send the current device state to the server.\n3. Validate the connections and handle exceptions accordingly to ensure the device retries sending data in case of failed attempts.\n\n### Required Imports:\n- `udp.h` for UDP connection functions\n- `thread.h` for threading utilities (used for delays)\n- `xtimer.h` for timing functions (to handle delays like the five-second interval)\n\nHere's the implementation code: \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <udp.h>\n#include <thread.h>\n\n#define SERVER_IP \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define SERVER_PORT 20001\n#define INTERVAL (5U * US_PER_SEC)  // 5 seconds\n\nstatic char *device_state = \"work\";  // or \"not work\"\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct sockaddr src;\n    struct sockaddr_dst;\n    struct udp_conn conn;\n    int rc;\n\n    // Connect to the UDP server\n    while (1) {\n        rc = udp_connect(&conn, NULL, SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT);\n        if (rc != 0) {\n            printf(\"Failed to connect to UDP server. Retrying in 1 second...\\n\");\n            xtimer_sleep(1);\n            continue;\n        }\n        printf(\"Connected to UDP server successfully.\\n\");\n        break;\n    }\n\n    // Sending loop\n    while (1) {\n        ssize_t num_bytes = udp_send(&conn, device_state, sizeof(device_state) - 1);\n        if(num_bytes < 0){\n            printf(\"Failed to send state.\\n\");\n            udp_disconnect(&conn);\n            // Try connecting again\n            rc = udp_connect(&conn, NULL, SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT);\n            if (rc != 0) {\n                printf(\"Failed to reconnect to UDP server.\\n\");\n                xtimer_sleep(1);\n                continue;\n            }\n        } else {\n            printf(\"State sent successfully.\\n\");\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
