            "prefix: The errors given indicate issues in the code related to NVS usage on ESP32 using RIOT. Here's a breakdown of the errors:\n1. The first error mentions the use of a function declaration that isn't a prototype. Typically, this occurs when a function is defined without specifying a void parameter list for functions not expecting any arguments. The fix is to ensure all functions are properly prototyped, specifying \"void\" if there are no parameters.\n\n2. The second error involves an old-style function definition, which often happens when the C99 or later conventions aren't followed. In C99, functions should be declared before they are defined.\n\n3. The third error mentions the implicit declaration of the function 'usleep', which implies it is called without being declared. This usually requires including the correct headers to provide the function declaration. You could replace 'usleep()' with 'sleep()' from the standard library, which may be already included via <unistd.h> or other system headers provided by RIOT.\n\nBelow is the corrected RIOT code block for an ESP32 device that continuously stores a device state in NVS every second. This implementation includes appropriate header files and function prototypes, and resolves any implicit declarations by ensuring the correct headers are included.\n\n \n block: #include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <nvs_flash.h>\n#include <nvs.h>\n\nvoid update_device_state(void);\n\nint main(void) {\n    esp_err_t err = nvs_flash_init();\n    if (err == ESP_ERR_NVS_NO_FREE_PAGES || err == ESP_ERR_NVS_NEW_VERSION_FOUND) {\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(nvs_flash_erase());\n        err = nvs_flash_init();\n    }\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(err);\n\n    for (;;) {\n        update_device_state();\n        sleep(1);  // Pause execution for 1 second\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid update_device_state(void) {\n    nvs_handle_t my_handle;\n    esp_err_t err = nvs_open(\"storage\", NVS_READWRITE, &my_handle);\n    if (err == ESP_OK) {\n        static int state = 0;\n        state = (state == 0) ? 1 : 0;  // Toggle state between 0 and 1\n        err = nvs_set_i32(my_handle, \"device_state\", state);\n        if (err == ESP_OK) {\n            nvs_commit(my_handle);\n        }\n        nvs_close(my_handle);\n    }\n} \n"
