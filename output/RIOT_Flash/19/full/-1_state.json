The error suggests that some functions like `nvs_flash_init` are not declared. Thus, ensure that the header files for NVS and any other necessary RIOT headers are included.\n\n2. **Temperature State Update**: Store the device state persistently by writing to NVS every second while continuously updating and checking for errors in storage.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement extensive error handling for the NVS functions, and perform retries on failure.\n\n4. **Libraries**: Ensures libraries for xtimer and NVS are used correctly.\n\nHere is the corrected code that demonstrates this process for storing a device state persistently every second. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <nvs_flash.h>\n\n#define STORAGE_NAMESPACE \"storage\"\n#define KEY_DEVICE_STATE \"device_state\"\n#define ITERATION_DELAY (1U) // seconds\n\nvoid setup_nvs(nvs_handle_t *handle) {\n    while (1) {\n        esp_err_t err = nvs_flash_init();\n        if (err == ESP_OK) {\n            printf(\"NVS Flash Initialized successfully\\n\");\n            break;\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Failed to initialize NVS Flash: %d.
