            "prefix: The errors that we need to fix involve two major issues: an incompatible pointer type error and an implicit function declaration error. The first error occurs due to a mismatch in the argument type passed to the 'nvs_get_i32' function. The third argument should be a pointer to an int32_t variable where the value will be stored. The second error is due to an implicit declaration of the 'random_uint32_range' function, which suggests a missing include directive for the proper declaration of this function. The solution involves ensuring that the third argument in 'nvs_get_i32' is of the correct pointer type and adding the appropriate header for the 'random_uint32_range' function.\n\nThe following solution resolves these errors:\n\n1. Correct the type of the third argument in the call to 'nvs_get_i32' by declaring a variable of type 'int32_t' and passing its address.\n2. Include the appropriate header file for the 'random_uint32_range' function, which is possibly 'random.h' based on its name.\n3. Use an appropriate sequence of header files as per the requirements in descending alphabetical order. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <random.h>\n#include <nvs.h>\n#include <inttypes.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nnvs_handle_t my_handle;\n\nint main(void) {\n    int32_t device_state = 0;\n    esp_err_t err;\n    err = nvs_open(\"storage\", NVS_READWRITE, &my_handle);\n    if (err != ESP_OK) {\n        printf(\"Error (%d) opening NVS handle!\\n\", err);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Open NVS handle successfully.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Reading initial value...\\n\");\n    err = nvs_get_i32(my_handle, \"device_state\", &device_state);\n    switch (err) {\n        case ESP_OK:\n            printf(\"Device state read successfully: %\" PRId32 \"\\n\", device_state);\n            break;\n        case ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND:\n            printf(\"The value is not initialized yet!\\n\");\n            device_state = 0;\n            break;\n        default :\n            printf(\"Error (%d) reading the value from NVS!\\n\", err);\n            break;\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        device_state = (device_state == 0) ? 1 : 0;\n        printf(\"Writing device state %\" PRId32 \" to NVS...\\n\", device_state);\n        err = nvs_set_i32(my_handle, \"device_state\", device_state);\n        if (err != ESP_OK) {\n            printf(\"Failed to write to NVS!\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Successfully written to NVS!\\n\");\n        }\n        nvs_commit(my_handle);\n\n        int32_t temperature = (int32_t)random_uint32_range(0, 100);\n        printf(\"Temperature: %\" PRId32 \"\\n\", temperature);\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    nvs_close(my_handle);\n    return 0;\n} \n"
