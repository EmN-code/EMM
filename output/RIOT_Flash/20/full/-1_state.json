            "prefix: The error suggests that there's a type mismatch when you're passing a pointer to the `nvs_get_i32` function, which expects a specific pointer type. This typically occurs when you're trying to store or retrieve data. The key functions here involve writing and reading from the NVS storage on the ESP32. The solution involves ensuring correct parameter types for these functions.
