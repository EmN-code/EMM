            "prefix: This code demonstrates how to utilize the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) on an ESP32 using RIOT to store a device state persistently. The device repeatedly stores the state ('1' or '0') every second. To achieve this, NVS is initialized and opened with read/write access. The state is toggled and written to NVS every second. To handle the absence of direct RIOT support for ESP32 NVS in this setup, ESP-IDF's NVS functionality is hypothetically referenced; hence, the header files are included as per standard ESP32 setup. The issue with the linking error is due to missing references during compile time, often needing defined components or systems (like those in ESP-IDF) to be linked properly. Note that while 'xtimer_sleep' is a common way to introduce delays in RIOT, its use here is replaced by an infinite loop and placeholder print statement to keep logic within constraints outlined (such as blacklisted items). \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <nvs_flash.h>\n#include <nvs.h>\n\nvoid app_main() {\n    if (nvs_flash_init() != ESP_OK) {\n        printf(\"NVS Flash init failed!\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    nvs_handle_t my_handle;\n    if (nvs_open(\"storage\", NVS_READWRITE, &my_handle) != ESP_OK) {\n        printf(\"Error opening NVS handle!\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    int8_t device_state = 0;\n    while (true) {\n        device_state = !device_state; // Toggle state\n        if (nvs_set_i8(my_handle, \"device_state\", device_state) != ESP_OK) {\n            printf(\"Failed to write to NVS!\\n\");\n        }\n        if (nvs_commit(my_handle) != ESP_OK) {\n            printf(\"Failed to commit changes to NVS!\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Device state saved: %d\\n\", device_state);\n        }\n        for (uint32_t i = 0; i < 100000000; ++i) {\n            ; // Simulate sleep\n        }\n    }\n\n    nvs_close(my_handle); // Should close only if there's a loop break or exit\n}\n\nint main() {\n    app_main();\n    return 0;\n} \n"
