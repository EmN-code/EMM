### Pattern Extraction:

**Current FSMs Pattern:**
1. INIT -> CONNECT
   - MQTT_BROKER_ADDR_PARSED -> CONNECT (if address parsing is successful)
   - MQTT_BROKER_ADDR_PARSE_FAILED -> ERROR (if failed)

2. CONNECT -> REGISTER
   - MQTT_CONNECT_OK -> REGISTER (successful connection to the broker)
   - MQTT_CONNECT_FAILED -> RETRY_CONNECT (on failure, attempt to reconnect)

3. REGISTER -> PUBLISH
   - REGISTRATION_OK -> PUBLISH (topic registration successful)
   - REGISTRATION_FAILED -> ERROR (registration failed)

4. PUBLISH -> PUBLISH or ERROR
   - PUBLISH_OK -> PUBLISH (successful publish)
   - PUBLISH_FAILED -> ERROR (publish failed)

5. ERROR -> INIT
   - RETRY -> INIT (retry the initialization process)

6. RETRY_CONNECT -> CONNECT
   - RETRY_CONNECT_OK -> CONNECT (retry connection successful)
   - RETRY_CONNECT_FAILED -> ERROR

**Reference FSMs Pattern:**
1. INIT -> NETWORK_INIT
   - Network_Init_Start -> NETWORK_INIT

2. NETWORK_INIT -> MQTT_INIT
   - Network_Init_Success -> MQTT_INIT
   - Network_Init_Fail -> NETWORK_RECONNECT (on failure, reconnect to network)

3. NETWORK_RECONNECT -> MQTT_INIT
   - Network_Reconnect_Success -> MQTT_INIT
   - Network_Reconnect_Fail -> ERROR

4. MQTT_INIT -> PUBLISH
   - MQTT_Connect_Success -> PUBLISH
   - MQTT_Connect_Fail -> NETWORK_RECONNECT (reconnect if connection fails)

5. PUBLISH -> PUBLISH or ERROR
   - Publish_Success -> PUBLISH
   - Publish_Fail -> ERROR

6. ERROR -> NETWORK_INIT
   - Recover -> NETWORK_INIT

### Analysis of Differences:
- The Current FSMs skips initial network setup and MQTT client initialization which are reflected in the reference FSMs.
- Error recovery process directly returns to INIT in Current FSMs, whereas it attempts a network reconnection in the reference FSMs.
- The MQTT connection retry logic in Current FSMs is direct, whereas in reference FSMs, it handles network reconnection and then attempts MQTT reconnection.
- The ref_FSMs separate network and MQTT connection setups explicitly; the current code assumes network is ready and focuses more on MQTT connection and publish operations.

### Incorrect Matching Patterns and Corrective Measures

1. **Network Initialization:**
    - **Current Issue:** The current code does not handle network initialization or reconnection processes.
    - **Correction:** Implement a network initialization state. Use a retry mechanism for both network and MQTT connection failures. This can help in scenarios where the network is unstable.

2. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
    - **Current Issue:** Direct transitioning from ERROR to INIT without addressing network issues.
    - **Correction:** Update the ERROR state transitions to include network reconnection attempts as seen in the reference FSMs.

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
    - **Current Issue:** MQTT connection logic is tied directly to initial state transitions.
    - **Correction:** Separate the network setup and MQTT setup logic in different states to follow a modular approach as shown in the reference FSM.

By making these changes, the logical clarity and robustness of the system can be improved, allowing better handling of network-related issues prior to MQTT operations.
