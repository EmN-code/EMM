            "prefix: This Contiki code is for an NRF52840 platform and is designed to send a CoAP POST request to a CoAP server. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Include Required Headers**: The necessary headers are included in alphabetical order.\n2. **Define Constants**: Constants like the server endpoint, CoAP URI, and message to be sent are defined for easy modification and reuse.\n3. **Process Definition**: The process `coap_client_process` is defined and set to autostart. This means it will automatically begin execution when the device boots.\n4. **Process Implementation**:\n   - The process initializes by parsing the server endpoint address.\n   - It enters a loop where it constructs and sends the CoAP POST requests. This loop currently continues indefinitely.\n   - Inside the loop, it initializes the request with the POST method and sets the URI path and payload.\n   - It uses the `COAP_BLOCKING_REQUEST` macro to perform the request, which will handle sending and possibly waiting for a response if needed.\n5. **Main Function Not Needed**: Contiki applications use processes instead of the traditional C `main()` function for execution. The `AUTOSTART_PROCESSES` macro takes care of starting the processes.\n\nThis code will repeatedly send the message \"Hello, COAP Cloud\" to the specified CoAP server at the specified URI path. \n block: #include \"contiki.h\"\n#include \"coap-engine.h\"\n#include \"coap-blocking-api.h\"\n\n#define SERVER_EP \"coap://47.102.103.1:5683\"\n#define COAP_URI \"/coap/test\"\n#define HELLO_MSG \"Hello, COAP Cloud\"\n\nPROCESS(coap_client_process, \"CoAP Client Process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&coap_client_process);\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(coap_client_process, ev, data)\n{\n  PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n  static coap_endpoint_t server_ep;\n  static coap_message_t request[1];  /* This way the packet can be treated as pointer as usual. */\n\n  coap_endpoint_parse(SERVER_EP, strlen(SERVER_EP), &server_ep);\n\n  while(1) {\n    printf(\"Sending CoAP POST request to %s%s\\n\", SERVER_EP, COAP_URI);\n\n    coap_init_message(request, COAP_TYPE_CON, COAP_POST, 0);\n    coap_set_header_uri_path(request, COAP_URI);\n    coap_set_payload(request, (uint8_t *)HELLO_MSG, sizeof(HELLO_MSG) - 1);\n\n    COAP_BLOCKING_REQUEST(&server_ep, request, NULL);\n\n    PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&et));\n  }\n\n  PROCESS_END();\n}\n \n"
