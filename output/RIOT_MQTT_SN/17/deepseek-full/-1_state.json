            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: In the current FSM pattern, the transitions primarily focus on MQTT connect, registration, and publishing state, while in ref_FSMs, there are multiple threads and conditions like socket creation and COAP request handling.\n\nPatterns Extracted:\n1. Current FSM:\n   - INIT -> MQTT_CONNECT -> REGISTER_TOPIC -> PUBLISH_MESSAGES -> WAIT -> PUBLISH_MESSAGES...\n   - Errors in PUBLISH_MESSAGES or MQTT_CONNECT lead to ERROR and eventually try reconnecting.\n\n2. Referenced FSM:\n   - START -> SOCKET_CREATE -> SET_SERVER_ADDRESS -> SEND_COAP_REQUEST -> CLOSE_SOCKET\n   - Includes error handling and thread management (e.g., THREAD1_RUNNING, THREAD2_RUNNING) with message passing between threads.\n\nDifferences:\n- Current FSM lacks robust error recovery logic found in the ref_FSMs that include socket creation and handling.\n- The ref_FSMs show a structured flow involving multiple states for message handling across threads.\n\nIncorrect Matching and Suggestions:\n1. Error Handling: The current FSM lacks distinct states for handling failures beyond simple transitions back and forth in error cases.\n   - Suggestion: Add more robust error handling states such as 'RECONNECT_FAILURE', 'NETWORK_ISSUE', leading to reconnection logic similar to ref_FSMs.\n\n2. Concurrency Handling: The ref_FSMs handle multiple threads with responses between them. The current FSM doesn't reflect this.\n   - Suggestion: Introduce states that handle concurrent operations or threads for better structured message processing and interaction, resembling THREAD states.\n\n3. System Shutdown: The ref_FSMs include transition to an 'EXIT' state, which is absent in the current FSM where the system keeps publishing indefinitely.\n   - Suggestion: Implement a termination state after robust error handling or user-triggered shutdown logic.\n\nImproving these areas can enhance the reliability and correctness of the current FSM in handling failures, concurrency, and clean shutdowns."
