            "prefix: In this solution, we will develop a RIOT application for the ESP32 that publishes a \"work or not work\" state every five seconds to an MQTT-SN broker located at 47.102.103.1:1883 utilizing the `emcute` library for MQTT-SN communication, which is optimized for constrained devices like the ESP32.\n\nWe start by including the necessary headers for `xtimer`, `emcute`, Socket UDP endpoints, and standard libraries like `stdio` and `string`. We'll define constants for the MQTT-SN broker, such as port, client ID, and the topic `device/state` on which state messages will be published. The `DELAY` constant determines the five-second interval for message publication.\n\nThe `emcute_thread` initializes and runs the `emcute` MQTT client library in a separate thread. The `publish` function encapsulates the logic for publishing a message to the MQTT-SN broker. It sets up the topic structure and calls `emcute_pub` to publish the state to the broker.\n\nIn the `main` function, we start the `emcute` thread and configure the broker address using an IPv6 socket endpoint. The `emcute_con` function is called to establish a connection to the broker, and the main loop continuously publishes alternating \"work\" and \"not work\" states every five seconds. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"net/ipv6/addr.h\"\n#include \"net/emcute.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define EMCUTE_PORT     1883\n#define EMCUTE_ID       \"esp32\"\n#define EMCUTE_PRIO     (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define BROKER_IP       \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define PUB_TOPIC       \"device/state\"\n#define DELAY           (5U * 1000000U)  // 5 seconds in microseconds\n\nstatic char stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT];\nstatic emcute_topic_t t;\n\nstatic void *emcute_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    emcute_run(EMCUTE_PORT, stack, sizeof(stack), EMCUTE_PRIO);\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nstatic int publish(const char *state) {\n    unsigned flags = EMCUTE_QOS_0;\n    emcute_topic_t topic;\n    topic.id = 0; /* dummy value */\n    topic.name = PUB_TOPIC;\n\n    if (emcute_pub(&topic, state, strlen(state), flags) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        printf(\"[FAILED] to publish data\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Published %s on topic %s\\n\", state, PUB_TOPIC);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Start the emcute thread */\n    thread_create(stack, sizeof(stack), EMCUTE_PRIO, 0, emcute_thread, NULL, \"emcute\");\n\n    /* Configuration of broker address */\n    sock_udp_ep_t gw = { .family = AF_INET6, .port = EMCUTE_PORT };\n    ipv6_addr_from_str((ipv6_addr_t *)&gw.addr.ipv6, BROKER_IP);\n\n    if (emcute_con(&gw, true, \"\") != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        printf(\"[FAILED] to connect to broker\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"Connected to broker at %s\\n\", BROKER_IP);\n\n    /* Main loop to publish state periodically */\n    while (1) {\n        publish(\"work\");\n        xtimer_sleep(DELAY / 1000000);\n        publish(\"not work\");\n        xtimer_sleep(DELAY / 1000000);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
