            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Pattern Analysis:\n\n**Current FSMs (curr_FSMs) Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> CONNECT\n2. CONNECT (either connects successfully or fails) -> PUBLISH or EXIT\n3. PUBLISH (either publishes successfully or fails) -> PUBLISH_WAIT or ERROR\n4. ERROR -> CONNECT\n\n**Reference FSMs (ref_FSMs) Pattern 1:**\n1. INIT -> NETWORK_INIT\n2. NETWORK_INIT (success leads to connecting broker, failure leads to reconnect) -> CONNECT_BROKER or NETWORK_RECONNECT\n3. CONNECT_BROKER (either connects successfully or fails) -> REGISTER_TOPIC or ERROR\n4. REGISTER_TOPIC (either successfully registers or fails) -> PUBLISH or ERROR\n5. PUBLISH (either publishes successfully or fails) -> WAIT or ERROR\n6. ERROR -> NETWORK_INIT\n\n**Reference FSMs (ref_FSMs) Pattern 2:**\n1. INIT -> CONNECTING\n2. CONNECTING (either connects successfully or fails) -> SUBSCRIBING or ERROR\n3. SUBSCRIBING (either subscribes successfully or fails) -> PUBLISHING_LOOP or ERROR\n4. PUBLISHING_LOOP (handles into loop on success, error handling on fail)\n5. PUBLISH_ERROR_HANDLING -> PUBLISHING_LOOP\n6. ERROR -> RESTART\n\n### Differences and Issues in Current Code (curr_code):\n1. **Missing Initial Network Initialization:**\n   - The reference FSMs have a distinct NETWORK_INIT state that is omitted in the current FSM and code. This may imply the need for initial network checks or setups that the current code doesn't perform.\n\n2. **Register Topic Missing:**\n   - In the reference FSMs, after connecting to a broker, the process includes a REGISTER_TOPIC (with handling for success/failure) before publishing. In the current code, topic registration is tried and reported if fails, but there's no retry mechanism.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Recovery:**\n   - Reference FSMs have robust error handling where any error returns to an initialization phase (NETWORK_INIT or RESTART), whereas the current FSMs simply attempt to reconnect. The recovery process should follow a more comprehensive reset path.\n\n4. **Loop Structure in Publishing:**\n   - The current FSM loops on `PUBLISH_WAIT` with a simple TIMER expiration condition, but the references use a more structured PUBLISHING_LOOP with error handling, suggesting more structured cycle control might be needed.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Implement Network Initialization:**\n   - Add a `NETWORK_INIT` function to handle any network setup tasks and provide appropriate transitions based on success or fail.\n\n2. **Integrate Topic Registration Check:**\n   - Modify the `publish_state` function to include a more robust registration check and potentially retry strategy for topic registration.\n\n3. **Enhance Error Handling:**\n   - Expand the `ERROR` state to re-initialize resources as in `NETWORK_INIT` and retry the connection process, possibly by calling `emcute_init` again or similar functions.\n\n4. **Enhance Publishing Loop Handling:**\n   - Consider implementing a publishing loop similar to ref_FSMs that better manages retries and maintains a stable connection/publish state. This might include delay handling or managing states during publishing directly."

            "prefix: To solve the errors indicated and provide a functioning RIOT application using the emcute library to publish MQTT-SN messages, we need to ensure that all defined variables and functions are used appropriately. Specifically, the error messages indicate unused functions and variables, which means they need to be correctly integrated or removed if unnecessary. Here's the approach we've taken:\n\n1. **Remove unused functions and variables**: Ensure all necessary components for the main functionality of connecting, registering the topic, and publishing are used effectively.\n\n2. **Ensure proper use of threading**: Create a separate thread for handling periodic publishing, ensuring that the main thread initializes the connection and topic registration successfully.\n\n3. **Implement the necessary includes and setup**: Use the correct order for includes and establish the _stack variable for threading, and ensure all necessary components are engaged in the process.\n\nThe resulting code provides a complete setup for connecting to an MQTT-SN broker, registering a topic, and publishing messages at five-second intervals. \n block: #include <net/ipv6/addr.h>\n#include <net/emcute.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n\n#define EMCUTE_ID           \"gertrud\"\n#define EMCUTE_PORT         (1883U)\n#define SERVER_ADDR         \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define SERVER_PORT         (1883U)\n#define TOPIC_NAME          \"state\"\n#define PUB_INTERVAL        (5U * 1000000U)\n\nstatic char _stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT];\nstatic emcute_topic_t _topic;\n\nstatic int connect_to_broker(void) {\n    sock_udp_ep_t gw = { .family = AF_INET6, .port = SERVER_PORT };\n    if (ipv6_addr_from_str((ipv6_addr_t *)&gw.addr.ipv6, SERVER_ADDR) == NULL) {\n        puts(\"error: unable to parse server address\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (emcute_con(&gw, true, NULL, NULL, 0, 0) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        puts(\"error: not able to connect to broker\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int register_topic(void) {\n    unsigned flags = EMCUTE_QOS_0;\n    _topic.name = TOPIC_NAME;\n    if (emcute_reg(&_topic) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        puts(\"error: unable to obtain topic ID\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int publish_state(const char *state) {\n    unsigned flags = EMCUTE_QOS_0;\n    if (emcute_pub(&_topic, state, strlen(state), flags) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        puts(\"error: unable to publish data\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    puts(\"published successfully\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic void *thread_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    char *state = \"work\";\n    while (1) {\n        publish_state(state);\n        xtimer_usleep(PUB_INTERVAL);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    msg_init_queue(_msg_queue, ARRAY_SIZE(_msg_queue));\n    if (connect_to_broker() != 0) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    if (register_topic() != 0) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    thread_create(_stack, sizeof(_stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, 0, thread_handler, NULL, \"pub_thread\");\n    return 0;\n} \n"
