            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Pattern Extraction and Analysis\n\n**Current FSMs Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> CONNECT -> REGISTER -> PUBLISH -> ERROR -> DISCONNECT -> END\n2. Error handling paths such as IP_CONVERT_FAIL lead to ERROR, but do not attempt reconnection.\n3. Disconnection is immediate after any error, leading to END state without retries.\n\n**Reference FSMs Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> WIFI_INIT -> WIFI_CONNECTED -> SEND_COAP -> RESPONSE_HANDLER\n2. Error handling includes recovery and retry mechanisms, with states like WIFI_RECONNECT and RETRY_SEND_COAP.\n3. Errors can lead to reconnection attempts (e.g., WIFI_RECONNECT) and retry logic (RETRY_SEND_COAP).\n4. Existence of an overall retry or recovery mechanism that loops back to a known good state after failures.\n\n### Incorrect Patterns in Current FSM and Corrective Measures:\n\n1. **Lack of Retry Mechanism: **\n   - **Current:** In the current FSM, on failure (e.g., MQTT_CONNECT_FAIL, TOPIC_REGISTER_FAIL), the program immediately goes to DISCONNECT and ends.\n   - **Ideal:** Implement retry logic similar to the ref_FSMs. For instance, after MQTT_CONNECT_FAIL, attempt reconnection before disconnecting.\n\n2. **Immediate Transition to END:**\n   - **Current:** Upon any error, the system immediately transitions to DISCONNECT, leading to END, without attempting any corrective measures.\n   - **Corrective Measure:** Add intermediate steps such as a RETRY state or RECONNECT logic, similar to WIFI_RECONNECT or RETRY_SEND_COAP in reference FSM.\n\n3. **Robust Error Handling:**\n   - **Current:** Simple transitions to DISCONNECT on errors without any log or attempt to diagnose the issue further.\n   - **Corrective Measures:** Introduce a more detailed error handling and logging system that can enhance debugging. Possibly re-initialize or reset parts of the system when errors are encountered, as indicated by the RESET transitions in ref_FSMs.\n\nBy implementing more resilient error handling strategies and retry mechanisms present in the ref FSM, the current system can be improved to better handle edge cases and transient errors."
