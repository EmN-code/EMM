            "prefix: The goal is to solve the compilation errors in the RIOT program which connects to an MQTT-SN broker at 47.102.103.1:1883, for the ESP32 platform. The main issues were the incorrect usage of 'ipv6' instead of 'ipv4', and the use of 'xtimer_sleep' which should be replaced with 'ztimer_sleep'. Additionally, careful attention was paid in organizing header files in descending order, as required, and ensuring that the necessary functions and methods are correctly implemented.\n\nThe program uses the emcute library to connect and publish state updates every five seconds to the specified broker.
