            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: The provided curr_FSMs and the reference FSMs describe the state transitions for an MQTT-SN client application. Here\u2019s the pattern analysis and identification of issues:\n\n### Pattern Extraction\n\n**curr_FSMs Pattern:**\n- INIT -> (EMCUTE_RUN_OK) -> CONNECT\n- CONNECT -> (MQTTSN_CON_OK) -> REGISTER\n- REGISTER -> (TOPIC_REG_OK) -> PUBLISH\n- PUBLISH -> (PUB_OK) -> PUBLISH_WAIT -> (WAIT_TIMEOUT) -> PUBLISH\n- CONNECT_RETRY \n\n**ref_FSMs Pattern:**\n- INIT -> TIMER_SLEEP_COMPLETE -> NETWORK_INIT\n- NETWORK_INIT -> NETWORK_INIT_COMPLETE -> MQTT_INIT\n- MQTT_INIT -> MQTT_INIT_COMPLETE -> NETWORK_CONNECT\n- NETWORK_CONNECT -> (MQTT_CONNECT_SUCCESS) -> PUBLISH\n- NETWORK_CONNECT -> (MQTT_CONNECT_FAIL) -> NETWORK_RETRY\n- NETWORK_RETRY -> DELAY_COMPLETE -> NETWORK_CONNECT\n\n### Difference Analysis\n\n- **State Initialization:**\n  - In ref_FSMs, the initialization is detailed with additional states: NETWORK_INIT and MQTT_INIT. This ensures that network and MQTT client are initialized separately before attempting to connect.\n  - curr_FSMs directly transitions from INIT to CONNECT without explicit handling of network and MQTT initialization phases.\n\n- **Networking Details:**\n  - ref_FSMs mention a clear path if the network initialization fails, attempting reconnection after some delay, while curr_FSMs have a broader CONNECT_RETRY state but lack details like delay mechanisms before retrying network connections.\n\n- **Error Handling and Retries:**\n  - ref_FSMs have detailed error management and retry mechanisms (e.g., connect retries with timing controls), while curr_FSMs stop at ERROR state and do not match reference retry strategies directly.\n\n- **Publishing Strategy:**\n  - Both FSMs enter a publishing state, but the ref_FSMs uses a more robust state control by adding a SLEEP or WAIT state with an explicit timeout before publishing again, ensuring control over resource and timing, while curr_FSMs merely loops back to PUBLISH state with an assumption of time passing.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n\n1. **Detailed Initialization:**\n   - Add explicit states and transitions in the code for initializing network and MQTT client similar to ref_FSMs.\n2. **Retry Mechanism:**\n   - Implement detailed retry logic with appropriate delays between retries for failed connections and subscriptions using something similar to ref_FSMs.\n3. **Error Management:**\n   - Enhance error handling by adding more specific transitions to address possible failure points and retries as depicted in the reference FSMs.\n4. **Controlled Publishing:**\n   - Introduce a timer and WAIT state that controls how the application waits before attempting to publish again to avoid rapid resources exhaustion.\n5. **Connection and Reconnection Logic:**\n   - Include connection success and fail transitions with retries rather than moving to an error state immediately as in the reference."
