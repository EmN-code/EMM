            "prefix: To develop RIOT code on an ESP32 that initializes and starts an event_periodic callback function every second, we'll use focused imports and constructs. The code involves setting up a periodic timer callback that triggers every second. The timer initialization and callback setup will be done using RIOT's native timer functionalities. Here's the detailed explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Include Headers**: We include necessary headers for using the standard input-output library and for interacting with XTIMER, a part of RIOT that provides soft real-time timers.\n\n2. **Define the Callback Function**: We define `event_periodic`, which is the function to be called periodically.\n\n3. **Main Function Setup**: In the `main` function, we initialize the period for the timer (e.g., 1 second using the appropriate constants for microseconds) and start the periodic timer that calls `event_periodic` every second.\n\n4. **Timer Initialization**: We set up XTIMER for periodic events using its provided API, ensuring the function `event_periodic` is linked to execute at specified intervals.\n\nThe imports are ordered in descending alphabetical order as required. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Constant for one second (in microseconds)\n#define TIMER_PERIOD (1U * US_PER_SEC)\n\n// Callback function that will be triggered every second\nvoid event_periodic(void)\n{\n    printf(\"Timer callback function called.\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"Periodic event setup starting.\\n\");\n    \n    // Initialize the timer\n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n    \n    while (1) {\n        // Wait to elapse the period\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, TIMER_PERIOD);\n        \n        // Call the callback function\n        event_periodic();\n    }\n    \n    return 0;  // Although this line is never reached\n} \n"
