            "prefix: The task is to create a RIOT application for the ESP32 that executes a callback function every second. The solution involves using the `xtimer` module, which is specifically designed for high-precision timing tasks in RIOT. Here is how the problem is approached:\n\n1. **Header Inclusions**: It is essential to include the `xtimer` and `timex` modules to handle timing and time conversions respectively. Additionally, the `stdio.h` module is included for printing outputs to the console.\n\n2. **Define the Interval**: Define a constant `INTERVAL` representing the desired period of 1 second, calculated using `US_PER_SEC` which denotes a second in microseconds.\n\n3. **Callback Function**: Implement a simple `callback()` function that outputs a message to indicate it was triggered.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The `main()` function manages the timing loop. It initializes a starting point using `xtimer_now()`. Inside an infinite loop, it waits for the defined interval using `xtimer_periodic_wakeup()`, then calls the `callback()` function.\n\n5. **Loop Management**: The loop ensures that the callback is triggered every second by sleeping the precise amount required for accurate intervals.\n\nThis solution leverages the precise timing capabilities of the `xtimer` library to achieve the desired functionality. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <timex.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define INTERVAL (1U * US_PER_SEC)\n\nstatic void callback(void *arg) {\n    puts(\"Callback trigger every second\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    xtimer_ticks32_t last_wakeup = xtimer_now();\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_periodic_wakeup(&last_wakeup, INTERVAL);\n        callback(NULL);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
