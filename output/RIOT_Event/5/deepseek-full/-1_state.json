Consistent naming can help maintain clarity, especially in large systems.\n\n2. **State Naming Conventions:**\n   - The initial waiting state is named WAIT in curr_FSMs, whereas in ref_FSMs it's WAIT_FOR_EVENT. This more descriptive name helps clarify that the system is waiting for a specific event.\n\n3. **Event Transition Naming:**\n   - The condition 'PERIODIC_EVENT_TRIGGERED' in curr_FSMs corresponds to 'EVENT_TRIGGERED' in ref_FSMs.\n\n4. **Callback Execution Transition Naming:**\n   - In curr_FSMs, the transition back to the WAIT state is named 'CALLBACK_DONE', whereas in ref_FSMs it's called 'CALLBACK_COMPLETE'.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n\n- **Uniform Naming:** Unify naming convention across state machines according to a predefined naming standard. Use descriptive and clear terms that match the domain, like 'INIT_COMPLETE' for initialization and 'WAIT_FOR_EVENT'.\n\n- **Additional Details:** Add detailed comments or documentation within the code explaining what each state and transition does. This will reduce misunderstandings and errors, especially when dealing with callback execution.\n\n- **State Robustness:** Consider including exception handling related states and transitions, e.g., any recovery mechanisms from unexpected state transitions or interrupts, which are absent in the current FSM but might be necessary depending on system requirements."
