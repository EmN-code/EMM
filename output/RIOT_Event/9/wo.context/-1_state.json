            "prefix: This code initializes and starts a periodic callback function in RIOT on an ESP32. It uses the `xtimer` module, which is commonly used in RIOT for timer-based scheduling. The following steps outline the structure and functionality of the code:\n\n1. **Header Includes**: It includes the necessary header files, `xtimer.h` for timer functionality and `stdio.h` for input/output functions.\n\n2. **Timer Variable**: A static `xtimer_t` variable named `timer` is declared. This variable will hold the timer configuration and state.\n\n3. **Callback Function**: A callback function `timer_callback` is defined. This function is void and takes a void pointer as an argument. The function contains a print statement that gets executed every time the callback is called. Additionally, it re-arms the timer to trigger the callback every second.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function is responsible for initializing and starting the timer:\n    - It prints a message indicating the start of the example.\n    - Sets the callback function and an optional argument (set to NULL in this case) to the timer.\n    - The timer is set for the first callback to occur after 1 second (1,000,000 microseconds).\n    - It enters a perpetual loop, utilizing `xtimer_sleep` to maintain synchronization with the timer callbacks.\n\nBy executing this code, you'll establish a periodic timer in the RIOT operating system that will print a message once every second, leveraging the ESP32's capabilities. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Timer variable\nstatic xtimer_t timer;\n\n// This is the callback function that will be called periodically\nvoid timer_callback(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg; // Unused parameter\n    printf(\"Periodic callback called!\\n\");\n\n    // Re-arm the timer for the next callback after 1 second (1e6 microseconds)\n    xtimer_set(&timer, 1000000);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"RIOT Timer Example - Periodic Callback\\n\");\n\n    // Initialize timer variable\n    timer.callback = timer_callback;\n    timer.arg = NULL;\n\n    // Set the timer for the first callback after 1 second\n    xtimer_set(&timer, 1000000);\n\n    // Enter the main event loop\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);  // Sleep for 1 second\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
