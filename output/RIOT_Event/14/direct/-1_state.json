            "prefix: In this RIOT-OS based application we are running on an ESP32. We aim to create a simple periodic callback using the `xtimer` library to trigger events every second. The program uses a separate thread to ensure that the main loop remains free for other tasks. The following steps are part of the solution:\n\n1. Include required headers to manage timers and threads.\n2. Define a macro for the period, which is set to one second (using microsecond granularity).\n3. Implement the `event_periodic` function, which will be called periodically \u2014 it simply prints a message.\n4. Create a thread handler function that continuously calls the `event_periodic` function every second. The handler sleeps for one second using `xtimer_sleep`, which accurately manages timing on the RIOT platform.\n5. In the `main` function, start by printing an initial starting message.\n6. Create a new thread that runs the `thread_handler` function. This separation of the main application thread from periodic tasks can help with application responsiveness and is a common pattern in embedded systems programming. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n\n#define PERIOD (1U * US_PER_SEC) // 1 second period\n\nvoid event_periodic(void)\n{\n    printf(\"Periodic event trigger\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid *thread_handler(void *arg)\n{\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n        event_periodic();\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"RIOT event_periodic example starting\\n\");\n    \n    thread_create(NULL, 0, THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, 0, thread_handler, NULL, \"periodic_thread\");\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
