            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: An analysis of the current code based on the provided FSM states reveals a few discrepancies and logical issues compared to the reference FSMs.\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup**:\n   - In the ref_FSMs, there is an _INIT_ state, which indicates that certain initialization tasks are required before transitioning to the next state. For instance, mailbox initialization and timer setups are handled at this stage with transitions to _TIMER_SET_ or _ERROR_ states based on their outcomes.\n   - In the current code, there is no explicit _INIT_ state or check for successful queue initialization and timer setup. This can lead to potential issues if either fails to initialize properly.\n   - **Corrective Measure**: Add an _INIT_ state where the message queue and timer are initialized. Ensure that these setups return logical checks to handle success or failure appropriately.\n\n2. **Timer and Callback Execution**:\n   - In the ref_FSMs, there's a dedicated _TIMER_SET_ that transitions to another state (e.g., _WAIT_FOR_MSG_) following a successful timer setup.\n   - The current code directly calls the `periodic_callback` without checking if the prior setup was successful. The periodic callback should depend on successful timer operation which is not clearly defined in the provided curr_FSMs.\n   - **Corrective Measure**: Ensure the timer setup is confirmed before entering the periodic callback loop. Consider a state like _TIMER_SETUP_ that checks if the timer has been properly configured.\n\n3. **Message Exchange and Handling**:\n   - There's a _WAIT_FOR_MSG_ state in the reference FSM indicating waiting for a message and transitioning successfully leads to other operations.\n   - The current code however doesn't handle scenarios where `msg_receive` might encounter an error (e.g., message not successfully received or processed).\n   - **Corrective Measure**: Add error handling conditions if message receipt isn\u2019t successful and ensure it reflects back to the _WAIT_FOR_MSG_ state, enhancing reliability.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Resilience**:\n   - The ref_FSM includes states like _ERROR_ with transitions that handle errors by retrying connections or initializations, which are absent in the curr_FSMs.\n   - **Corrective Measure**: Implement error-handling paths for possible failures in message sending, receiving, or timing functions to ensure standalone resilience and retries instead of the current linear flow, which might hang on failures."
