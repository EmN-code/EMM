            "prefix: This code demonstrates how to use the RIOT OS ztimer module to set up a periodic callback function on an ESP32. The program initializes a timer that calls the `event_periodic` function every second. The `ztimer` library is used to handle timing operations. The `event_periodic` function is set to execute at regular one-second intervals via the timer's callback mechanism.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n1. **Header Files**: Headers are included in reverse alphabetical order, which in this case include `ztimer.h` for the timer functions, `stdio.h` for input and output operations, and `inttypes.h` for integer type formatting.\n2. **Macro Definition**: `INTERVAL` is defined as one second (in milliseconds) using `ZTIMER_MSEC_PER_SEC`, which is a part of the `ztimer` module.\n3. **Timer Setup**: A static `ztimer_t` variable is declared for managing timer state.\n4. **Callback Function**: The `event_periodic` function prints a message every time it is called and resets the timer to trigger its next call after one second.\n5. **Main Function**: The main routine begins by printing an initialization message, setting the timer to call `event_periodic` every second, and then enters a main loop where other tasks could be performed.\n\nIf you want to run this code, make sure your environment is set up to compile for an ESP32 and the necessary RIOT build system configurations are made. \n block: #include <ztimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <inttypes.h>\n\n#define INTERVAL (1U * ZTIMER_MSEC_PER_SEC)\n\nstatic ztimer_t timer;\n\nvoid event_periodic(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Callback function called every second!\\n\");\n    ztimer_set(ZTIMER_MSEC, &timer, INTERVAL);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting periodic event example on ESP32\\n\");\n    \n    // Initialize the timer\n    ztimer_init();\n    \n    // Set the timer to call event_periodic for the first time\n    timer.callback = event_periodic;\n    ztimer_set(ZTIMER_MSEC, &timer, INTERVAL);\n    \n    while (1) {\n        // The main loop can be used for other tasks\n        // The event_periodic function will be called every second by the timer\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
