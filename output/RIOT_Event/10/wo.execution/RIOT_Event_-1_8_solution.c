/*
In RIOT, `xtimer` is commonly used for managing time. However, given that itâ€™s blacklisted in this context,
we'll need to use evtimer-related functions.

The evtimer functions are likely for managing events based on time but implemented differently from xtimer.
This code snippet will demonstrate initializing an event timer and leveraging it to execute a function periodically
without using xtimer.
