The MQTT broker is located at the IP address 47.102.103.1 with port 1883.\n\n1. **Include required headers**: Necessary headers for the modules being used are included. It follows the rule of descending alphabetical order as per user's instruction.\n2. **Define constants**: BROKER_IP, BROKER_PORT, PUBLISH_INTERVAL, CLIENT_ID, and MQTT_TOPIC are defined for convenience.\n3. **Declare variables**: An event timer `etimer` and an MQTT connection struct `conn` are declared to manage periodic publishing and the MQTT connection respectively.\n4. **Process definition**: The process is named `mqtt_publish_process` and added to the autostart processes.\n5. **Main process loop**:\n    - The MQTT connection is initiated and configured.\n    - A loop checks for established connection state; if not connected, the device attempts to reconnect.\n    - If connected, based on conditions, a state 'work' or 'not work' is selected and published to the broker.\n    - The event timer is used to trigger the publishing actions every 5 seconds. \n block: #include \"contiki.h\"\n#include \"mqtt.h\"\n#include \"sys/etimer.h\"\n#include \"sys/clock.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\n#define BROKER_IP \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define BROKER_PORT 1883\n#define PUBLISH_INTERVAL CLOCK_SECOND * 5\n#define CLIENT_ID \"nrf52840\"\n#define MQTT_TOPIC \"device/status\"\n\nstatic struct etimer publish_timer;\nstatic struct mqtt_connection conn;\n\nPROCESS(mqtt_publish_process, \"MQTT Example Process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&mqtt_publish_process);\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(mqtt_publish_process, ev, data)\n{\n    PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n    // Configure and initiate the MQTT connection\n    mqtt_register(&conn, &mqtt_publish_process, CLIENT_ID, mqtt_event, MAX_TCP_SEGMENT_SIZE);\n    mqtt_connect(&conn, BROKER_IP, BROKER_PORT, PUBLISH_INTERVAL / CLOCK_SECOND * 3);\n\n    // Wait for an acknowledgment that the connection is established\n    while(conn.state != MQTT_CONN_STATE_CONNECTED) {\n        PROCESS_PAUSE();\n    }\n\n    etimer_set(&publish_timer, PUBLISH_INTERVAL);\n\n    while(1) {\n        PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&publish_timer));\n\n        if(conn.state == MQTT_CONN_STATE_CONNECTED) {\n            const char *state = (CLOCK_SECOND % 10 > 5) ? \"work\" : \"not work\";\n            mqtt_publish(&conn, NULL, MQTT_TOPIC, state, strlen(state), MQTT_QOS_LEVEL_0, MQTT_RETAIN_OFF);\n            printf(\"Published state: %s\\n\", state);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"MQTT disconnected, attempting to reconnect\\n\");\n            mqtt_connect(&conn, BROKER_IP, BROKER_PORT, PUBLISH_INTERVAL / CLOCK_SECOND * 3);\n        }\n\n        etimer_reset(&publish_timer);\n    }\n\n    PROCESS_END();\n} \n"
