// The error indicates that the header file for the DHT11 sensor is missing. To resolve this, you need to make sure that the Contiki-NG environment is properly set up with all the necessary libraries and dependencies.

// Here is how you can write a Contiki-NG application for the NRF52840 platform that reads a DHT11 sensor every five seconds. Let's assume you have the proper libraries available for the sensor:

#include "contiki.h"
#include "dev/dht11.h"
#include <stdio.h>

static struct etimer timer;

PROCESS(dht11_read_process, "DHT11 Read Process");
AUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&dht11_read_process);

PROCESS_THREAD(dht11_read_process, ev, data)
{
  PROCESS_BEGIN();

  etimer_set(&timer, CLOCK_SECOND * 5);

  while(1) {
    PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&timer));

    int temperature, humidity;
    if(dht11_read(&temperature, &humidity) != DHT11_ERROR) {
      printf("Temperature: %d C, Humidity: %d%%\n", temperature, humidity);
    } else {
      printf("Failed to read from DHT11 sensor\n");
    }

    etimer_reset(&timer);
  }

  PROCESS_END();
}

int main(void) {
  process_start(&dht11_read_process, NULL);
  return 0;
}
