While access to the DHT11's functionality requires specific driver support (which isn't found in the basic Contiki library set), this example sets up the structure for reading every 5 seconds. The comments indicate where you would integrate DHT11 reading logic, once the appropriate driver support is included. \n block: #include \"contiki-net.h\"\n#include \"contiki.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define DHT11_PIN 2\n\nPROCESS(dht11_process, \"DHT11 Reader Process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&dht11_process);\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(dht11_process, ev, data)\n{\n  static struct etimer timer;\n\n  PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n  // Initialize the etimer to trigger every 5 seconds\n  etimer_set(&timer, CLOCK_SECOND * 5);\n\n  while(1) {\n    // Wait for the timer event\n    PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(ev == PROCESS_EVENT_TIMER);\n\n    printf(\"Reading DHT11 on GPIO pin %d\\n\", DHT11_PIN);\n    // Code to read from DHT11 would go here\n\n    // Restart the timer\n    etimer_reset(&timer);\n  }\n\n  PROCESS_END();\n} \n"
