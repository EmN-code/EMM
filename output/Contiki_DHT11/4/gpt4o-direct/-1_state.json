            "prefix: The following Contiki code is designed to run on an NRF52840 microcontroller. It is set up to read from a DHT11 sensor, which provides temperature and humidity data, every five seconds. The DHT11 is connected to GPIO pin 2.\n\nFirst, the necessary header files are included for DHT11 sensor communication, Contiki processes, and NRF GPIO access. These are essential for initializing the sensor, setting up timers, and handling GPIO interactions.\n\nThe process `dht11_process` is defined and autostarted. Within this process, the DHT11 is initialized on the specified GPIO pin. A Contiki timer (`etimer`) is set to run every five seconds. Within the main loop of the process, the code waits for the timer event to ensure the five-second interval is respected.\n\nUpon timer expiry, the DHT11 is read for its temperature and humidity data. This data is printed to the console. If the reading fails, an error message is displayed. The timer is then reset to continue this cycle.\n\nThe code uses the `etimer` module of Contiki to manage timing efficiently, ensuring the DHT11 is queried at regular intervals. \n block: #include \"dht.h\"\n#include \"contiki.h\"\n#include \"nrf_gpio.h\"\n\nPROCESS(dht11_process, \"DHT11 Process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&dht11_process);\n\nstatic struct etimer timer;\n#define DHT11_PIN 2\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(dht11_process, ev, data) {\n    PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n    // Initialize DHT11\n    dht_init(DHT11_PIN);\n\n    // Create a timer to fire every 5 seconds\n    etimer_set(&timer, CLOCK_SECOND * 5);\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Wait for the timer event\n        PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&timer));\n\n        int16_t temperature, humidity;\n        if (dht_read(&temperature, &humidity) == DHT_SUCCESS) {\n            printf(\"Temperature: %d.%d C, Humidity: %d.%d %%\\n\",\n                   temperature / 10, temperature % 10,\n                   humidity / 10, humidity % 10);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Failed to read from DHT11 sensor\\n\");\n        }\n\n        // Reset the timer\n        etimer_reset(&timer);\n    }\n\n    PROCESS_END();\n}\n \n"
