The DHT11 is connected to GPIO2. \n\n1. Start with including necessary headers. Ensure headers are listed in descending alphabetical order.\n2. Define a process for reading from the DHT11 sensor.\n3. Use a timer to schedule the reading every five seconds.\n4. Simulate reading from the DHT11 sensor, as actual sensor interaction would require dedicated libraries and setups specific to the NRF52840 and DHT11 interface.\n5. Print a message to the console when a reading is taking place.\n6. Configure the process to reset the timer after each read, so it continues to trigger every 5 seconds. \n block: #include \"contiki-default-conf.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"contiki.h\"\n\nPROCESS(dht11_reader_process, \"DHT11 Reader Process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&dht11_reader_process);\n\n#define DHT11_READ_INTERVAL (CLOCK_SECOND * 5)\n#define DHT11_PIN 2\n\nstatic struct etimer et;\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(dht11_reader_process, ev, data) {\n    PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n    printf(\"Starting DHT11 reader process\\n\");\n    etimer_set(&et, DHT11_READ_INTERVAL);\n\n    while(1) {\n        PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&et));\n        // Simulated reading from DHT11 sensor on GPIO2\n        printf(\"Reading data from DHT11 sensor on GPIO%d\\n\", DHT11_PIN);\n        // Here you would add the code to actually read the sensor\n\n        etimer_reset(&et);\n    }\n\n    PROCESS_END();\n} \n"
