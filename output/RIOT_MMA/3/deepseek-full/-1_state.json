For example, if an initialization attempt fails due to a specific error condition known to be recoverable, consider retrying initialization with altered settings or going through a \"recovery\" state.\n\n3. **Decision Making in Error State:** Implement a more robust error state that doesn't immediately retry initialization but instead assesses whether the error can be resolved, akin to the \"error_resolved\" condition in ref_FSMs.\n\n4. **Graceful exits or alerts:** Instead of looping indefinitely on errors or retrying without end, consider adding checks to break the loop after a certain number of retries or unexpected faults to prevent infinite loops during persistent failures."
