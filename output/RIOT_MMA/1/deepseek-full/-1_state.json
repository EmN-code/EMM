            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Error Analysis Report\n\n#### Patterns in the current FSM:\n1. **Initialization Failure Handling**: The current FSM initializes the sensor (`INIT` state) and transitions to a `READ_SENSOR` state if initialization is successful. If the initialization fails, it directly transitions to an `ERROR` state. There is no retry mechanism.\n2. **Sensor Reading & Sleep Loop**: The FSM reads sensor data and enters a `SLEEP` state after every successful read and then transitions back to `READ_SENSOR` state.\n\n#### Patterns in the reference FSMs:\n1. **Initialization Failure Handling**: The reference FSMs (both) have a mechanism to retry initialization processes in case of failure by transitioning back to the initialization state from the `ERROR` state when a retry condition is met.\n2. **Looping Behavior**: Reference FSMs have specific conditions to transition between states (e.g., counter conditions in `MESSAGE_LOOP`, error handling in `NVS_FLASH_INIT`, etc.). These conditions are not present in the current FSM for transitioning between `READ_SENSOR` and `SLEEP` states.\n\n#### Differences and Issues:\n- **Lack of Retry Mechanism**: Unlike the reference FSMs, the current FSM lacks a retry mechanism for returning from an `ERROR` state, particularly after initialization failure, leading to a dead-end upon failure.\n- **Simplistic State Transitioning**: The current FSM operates in a simplistic loop between reading the sensor and sleeping with no complex conditions (unlike the reference FSM which has message loop conditions and priority-based transitions).\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Implement a Retry Mechanism**:\n   - Modify the current FSM to include a retry mechanism from the `ERROR` state on initialization failure. \n   - Example: If initialization fails, after a certain retry interval, it should attempt to initialize again transitioning back to the `INIT` state under a `RETRY` condition.\n\n2. **Enhanced State Transition Logic**:\n   - Introduce conditions for transitions between `READ_SENSOR` and `SLEEP` states similar to the `MESSAGE_LOOP` conditions in the reference FSM.\n   - This could involve implementing checks, such as temperature thresholds, before allowing transition from sensor reading to sleeping or implementing priority-based readings based on certain conditions."
