            "prefix: The following code initializes a connection to an MQTT broker and publishes a message indicating a state (either 'work' or 'not work') every five seconds from an ESP32 running RIOT OS. The code makes use of the MQTT library's functionalities for setting up the client, connecting to the broker, and publishing messages. Here's how the solution is structured:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries:** First, necessary headers are imported based on alphabetical order.\n2. **Define constants:** The MQTT broker address, port, and publish interval are defined.\n3. **Define MQTT client and buffers:** A `mqtt_client_t` object for managing the connection, along with buffers for sending and receiving messages.\n4. **Mutex for MQTT operations:** A mutex is initialized to ensure thread-safe operations when publishing messages.\n5. **Publisher thread:** A separate thread continuously publishes messages every 5 seconds.\n6. **Main function:** This function initializes the MQTT client, connects to the broker, initializes the mutex, and starts the publisher thread.\n\n**Key Functions:**\n- `mqtt_init()` to initialize the MQTT client.\n- `mqtt_connect()` to connect to the broker.\n- `mqtt_publish()` to publish messages on a topic.\n- `xtimer_usleep()` to implement the sleep delay between publishes.\n\nEnsure your environment is set with the proper MQTT and network configurations before running this script. \n block: #include \"stdio.h\"\n#include \"string.h\"\n#include \"mqtt.h\"\n#include \"mutex.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n\n#define MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define MQTT_BROKER_PORT 1883\n#define PUBLISH_INTERVAL (5 * US_PER_SEC) /* 5 seconds interval */\n#define BASE_STACK_SIZE 1024\n\nstatic mqtt_client_t mqtt_client;\nstatic char stack[BASE_STACK_SIZE];\nstatic char sendbuf[256];\nstatic char recvbuf[256];\nstatic mutex_t mqtt_lock = MUTEX_INIT;\n\nstatic void *publisher(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    mqtt_pub_t pub;\n    int i = 0;\n\n    while (1) {\n        mutex_lock(&mqtt_lock);\n\n        pub.topic = \"state/pub\";\n        pub.payload = (i % 2 == 0) ? \"work\" : \"not work\";\n        pub.retain = 0;\n        pub.qos = MQTT_QOS_0;\n\n        if (mqtt_publish(&mqtt_client, &pub) != MQTT_OK) {\n            printf(\"Error: unable to publish\\n\");\n        }\n\n        mutex_unlock(&mqtt_lock);\n\n        xtimer_usleep(PUBLISH_INTERVAL);\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    mqtt_client_t client;\n    mqtt_connect_client_t connect_info;\n\n    connect_info.client_id = \"esp32_mqtt_client\";\n    connect_info.user = NULL;\n    connect_info.password = NULL;\n    connect_info.keep_alive = 60;\n\n    /* Initialize the MQTT client */\n    mqtt_init(&client, MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS, MQTT_BROKER_PORT, sendbuf, sizeof(sendbuf), recvbuf, sizeof(recvbuf), xtimer_now_usec);\n\n    /* Connect to the MQTT broker */\n    if (mqtt_connect(&client, &connect_info) != MQTT_OK) {\n        printf(\"Error: unable to connect to the broker\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    /* Initialize the mutex */\n    mutex_init(&mqtt_lock);\n\n    /* Start the publisher thread */\n    thread_create(stack, sizeof(stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, publisher, NULL, \"publisher thread\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
