CONNECT -> PUBLISH (condition: CONNECTION_SUCCESS)\n3. CONNECT -> CONNECT (condition: CONNECTION_FAIL)\n4. PUBLISH -> SLEEP (condition: PUBLISH_SUCCESS)\n5. PUBLISH -> CONNECT (condition: PUBLISH_FAIL)\n6. SLEEP -> PUBLISH (condition: AFTER_INTERVAL)\n\n**Ref_FSMs Pattern:**\nThe references have more intricate states and transitions involving error handling and monitoring, which highlight missing considerations in the curr_FSMs pattern.\n\n**Discrepancies and Issues:**\n- **Lack of Error Handling and Remediation:** In the ref_FSMs, each failure (e.g., RTC_INIT_FAIL, RTC_GET_TIME_FAIL) leads to error states, possibly indicating a systemic issue. However, in the curr_FSMs, issues such as connection failure are handled by looping back to CONNECT without moving to an explicit ERROR state.\n- **Retry Mechanism:** While the curr_FSMs do implement some retries in CONNECT and PUBLISH states, they lack complexity around these retries, such as checking if reconnection attempts exceed a certain threshold before terminating or altering the behavior.\n- **Missing Init/Completion Checks:** The curr_FSMs only focus on establishing and maintaining a connection without considering initialization completeness checks or properly ending a connection.\n\n**Corrective Measures:**\n1. **Implement Error States**: Introduce an ERROR state that captures behavior common to multiple error transitions, such as when CONNECTION_FAIL or PUBLISH_FAIL exceeds predefined attempts.\n2. **Include Initialization Validation:** Ensure MQTT initialization is validated before proceeding to CONNECT, adopting a similar mechanism seen in the reference FSMs.\n3. **Add Completion State:** Implement a COMPLETE state after successful transactions to improve program monitoring and debugging abilities.\n4. **Enhance Retry Mechanism**: Improve the existing retry logic to include retry counters with threshold limits to prevent endless retries and possible infinite loop scenarios.\n5. **State Confirmation**: On transitioning to CONNECTING, include a sub-state or FSM logic that explicitly confirms network readiness before MQTT connect operation."
