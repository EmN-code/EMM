            "prefix: To achieve the goal of connecting to an MQTT broker to publish state every five seconds on the ESP32 using RIOT, we'll need to utilize a library that supports MQTT communication without emcute. We'll use the `paho-mqtt` library for RIOT which helps establish an MQTT client easily. The state alternates between \"work\" and \"not work\" every five seconds. We'll design the code so that it handles connections efficiently while maintaining a simple loop to publish the state repeatedly.\n\n1. We include necessary headers for MQTT, network utilities, and threading.\n2. Define the broker address and the changeable state variable.\n3. Use a function to perform periodic publishing every five seconds, with `xtimer_sleep` to introduce the delay.\n4. Properly handle the MQTT client's connection initiation and message publishing mechanism.\n5. Utilize threading to ensure the MQTT client runs independently and publishes messages as per the requirement.\n\nOverall, the code is structured to ensure efficient and effective connection to the broker with continuous state publishing. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <net/af.h>\n#include <net/sock.h>\n#include <net/conn/ip.h>\n#include <mqtt.h>\n\n#define BROKER_IP \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define BROKER_PORT 1883\n#define PUBLISH_INTERVAL 5\n\nstatic char *states[2] = {\"work\", \"not work\"};\n\nstatic void publish_state(mqtt_client_t *client) {\n    static int state_index = 0;\n    const char *topic = \"device/state\";\n\n    while (1) {\n        mqtt_publish(client, NULL, topic, states[state_index], strlen(states[state_index]), MQTT_QOS_0, 0);\n        state_index = (state_index + 1) % 2;\n        xtimer_sleep(PUBLISH_INTERVAL);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    mqtt_client_t client;\n    sock_udp_ep_t broker_ep = {\n        .family = AF_INET,\n        .netif = SOCK_ADDR_ANY_NETIF,\n        .port = BROKER_PORT\n    };\n    ipv4_addr_t ipv4_broker_ip;\n    ipv4_addr_from_str(&ipv4_broker_ip, BROKER_IP);\n    memcpy(&broker_ep.addr.ipv4, &ipv4_broker_ip, sizeof(ipv4_addr_t));\n\n    mqtt_init(&client, &broker_ep, \"client_id\", NULL, NULL, 0);\n\n    if (mqtt_connect(&client, true, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0) != MQTT_CONNECT_ACCEPTED) {\n        printf(\"Failed to connect to the broker\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"Connected to the broker\\n\");\n\n    publish_state(&client);\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
