            "prefix: To develop a RIOT program that connects to an MQTT broker at IP 47.102.103.1 on port 1883, we'll make use of the standard MQTT client and Network functions provided by the RIOT-OS. \n\nWe'll establish a connection to the broker, and then in a loop, publish the device state every 5 seconds. To accomplish this, we'll leverage the MQTT protocol libraries and network functionalities such as NetworkConnect, MQTTPublish, and MQTTDisconnect. We will initialize the MQTT client, specify the broker address and port, and manage the connection in the main function.
