            "prefix: This code sets up a simple MQTT client on an ESP32 using RIOT OS to connect to a broker at IP address 47.102.103.1 on port 1883. The program publishes a message indicating the state (\u201cwork or not work\u201d) every five seconds. Here's an explanation of the code's key components: \n\n1. **Imports**: Includes necessary headers for network and MQTT functionality on RIOT OS. The headers are included in alphabetical order as required.\n\n2. **Definitions and Variables**: Set constants such as the broker's IP address and port. Initializes the MQTT client and buffer arrays for sending and reading MQTT messages.\n\n3. **`on_message_delivered` Function**: A callback function to log message delivery confirmation.\n\n4. **`prepare_and_connect` Function**: Sets up the network connection to the MQTT broker using the specified IP address and port. Initializes the MQTT client with the connection data structure.\n\n5. **`publish_state_loop` Function**: Continuously sends the `\"work or not work\"` status message to the broker every five seconds in a loop. It handles reconnection attempts when a message fails to publish.\n\n6. **`main` Function**: The entry point of the program calls the setup and publishing functions.\n\nCompile this code with RIOT, ensuring to adjust the build system (Makefile) to include necessary modules and network configurations for your ESP32 environment. The program will run indefinitely, periodically publishing data to the MQTT broker. \n block: // Import necessary libraries for MQTT and network functionalities\n#include \"net/sock/udp.h\"\n#include \"msg.h\"\n#include \"ztimer.h\"\n#include \"MQTTClient.h\"\n\n#define BROKER_IP \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define BROKER_PORT 1883\n#define UPDATE_INTERVAL 5\n\nstatic MQTTClient client;\nstatic Network network;\nstatic unsigned char sendbuf[80], readbuf[80];\nstatic int is_running = 1;\n\nvoid on_message_delivered(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    printf(\"Message delivered\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid prepare_and_connect(void) {\n    sock_udp_ep_t gw = { .family = AF_INET, .port = BROKER_PORT };\n    gw.addr.ipv4[0] = 47;\n    gw.addr.ipv4[1] = 102;\n    gw.addr.ipv4[2] = 103;\n    gw.addr.ipv4[3] = 1;\n\n    int result = NetworkConnect(&network, BROKER_IP, (int)BROKER_PORT);\n    if (result != SUCCESS) {\n        puts(\"Failed to connect to network\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    MQTTPacket_connectData data = MQTTPacket_connectData_initializer;\n    data.clientID.cstring = \"RIOT_ESP32\";\n    data.keepAliveInterval = 20;\n    data.cleansession = 1;\n\n    MQTTClientInit(&client, &network, 1000, sendbuf, sizeof(sendbuf), readbuf, sizeof(readbuf));\n\n    if (MQTTConnect(&client, &data) != SUCCESS) {\n        puts(\"Failed to connect to MQTT broker\");\n    }\n}\n\nvoid publish_state_loop(void) {\n    MQTTMessage message;\n    message.qos = QOS0;\n    message.retained = 0;\n    message.payload = \"work or not work\";\n    message.payloadlen = strlen(message.payload);\n\n    while (is_running) {\n        int rc = MQTTPublish(&client, \"state\", &message);\n        if (rc != SUCCESS) {\n            printf(\"Failed to publish message: %d\\n\", rc);\n        }\n\n        ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, UPDATE_INTERVAL * 1000);\n    }\n\n    MQTTDisconnect(&client);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    prepare_and_connect();\n    publish_state_loop();\n    return 0;\n} \n"
