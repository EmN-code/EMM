            "prefix: To develop a RIOT program for the ESP32 that connects to an MQTT broker and publishes a state message every five seconds without using the `emcute` library, we need to follow these steps: 1. Set up the environment for RIOT OS targeting the ESP32. 2. Implement the MQTT client using another layer that does not rely on `emcute`. In this case, we can utilize a simple MQTT library directly. 3. Set up a UDP socket for network communication as MQTT typically runs over TCP or UDP. 4. Use a timer or wait mechanism to periodically publish messages to the broker. Note: The code error 'implicit declaration of function 'inet_pton'' arises from a missing include directive for the header file that contains this function's declaration. To resolve this, ensure that the correct header files are included. The correct header file in this context is `<arpa/inet.h>`, which provides network definitions and functions including `inet_pton`. Below is the corrected program that addresses this issue and includes the proper header files in the correct order. \n block: #include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <xtimer.h>\n#include <net/sock/udp.h>\n\nstatic const char *MQTT_BROKER_IP = \"47.102.103.1\";\nstatic const uint16_t MQTT_BROKER_PORT = 1883;\nstatic sock_udp_ep_t remote;\n\nvoid publish_state(void) {\n    sock_udp_t sock;\n    sock_udp_ep_t local = SOCK_IPV4_EP_ANY;\n    inet_pton(AF_INET, MQTT_BROKER_IP, &remote.addr.ipv4);\n    remote.port = MQTT_BROKER_PORT;\n\n    if (sock_udp_create(&sock, &local, &remote, 0) < 0) {\n        puts(\"Error creating UDP socket\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    const char *state_message = \"work\";\n    printf(\"Publishing state to broker: %s\\n\", state_message);\n    if (sock_udp_send(&sock, state_message, strlen(state_message), &remote) < 0) {\n        puts(\"Failed to send state message\");\n    }\n\n    sock_udp_close(&sock);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    while (1) {\n        publish_state();\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
