            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Error Analysis and Suggestions:\n\n1. **Network Initialization**:\n   - **Current FSM**: In the current FSM, the process begins with 'INITIALIZE_REMOTE', attempting to set up the remote endpoint's address. If successful (VALID_ADDRESS), it transitions to 'CREATE_SOCKET'. If it fails (INVALID_ADDRESS), it moves to an ERROR state, which eventually retries the initialization.\n   - **Reference FSM**: The reference FSM on the other hand, begins with mapping the MQTT broker address, followed by a transition to either connection phase or error handling if the parse fails. This represents a slightly more structured initiation phase where network address parsing is distinctly separate.\n\n2. **Socket and Network Connection**:\n   - **Current FSM**: Once the address is validated, the transition to 'CREATE_SOCKET' is attempted. If socket creation is successful, it moves to 'SEND_MESSAGE'; otherwise, it falls back to ERROR.\n   - **Reference FSM**: The ref FSM includes a network connection check ('NETWORK_CONNECTED') similar to current 'CREATE_SOCKET', but it differentiates between network connection success and MQTT connection, emphasizing network status before MQTT/message related processes. This increases robustness by independently managing major phases: network then MQTT.\n\n3. **Messaging and Publishing**:\n   - **Current FSM**: It goes directly from 'CREATE_SOCKET' to 'SEND_MESSAGE', assuming MQTT and other messaging protocols are always ready once the UDP socket is up. However, UDP being a simpler protocol, this may overlook connection nuances present with protocols like MQTT.\n   - **Reference FSM**: It distinctively includes a 'REGISTER' state post connection. Validation of MQTT registration before publishing ensures smoother interaction checks before engaging message send attempts, reducing errors related to protocol mismatches, delays, or drops.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Retry**:\n   - **Current FSM**: The error handling is directly after any failure, but lacks granularity - going immediately to retry remote initialization.\n   - **Reference FSM**: A more nuanced approach to error handling, including dedicated states for retrying connections specifically. This improves resiliency in reconnect scenarios common in network applications.\n\n### Suggestive Corrections:\n\n- **Introduce a more granular Initialization Phase**: Follow ref FSM by introducing separate distinct 'INIT' and 'NETWORK_CONNECTED' phases.\n- **Add a Protocol Check**: Similar to the 'REGISTER' state in ref FSM. Ensure protocol-specific states (like MQTT registration handled before retrying message attempts).\n- **Enhance Retry Mechanism**: Differentiate between network layer retries and application layer (e.g., message publishing) retries to match ref FSM. This implies adding distinct retry targets such as 'RETRY_CONNECT' alongside general ERROR resolutions.\n- **Implement a Dedicated Message Publish Phase Checking**: Ensuring that after MQTT is successfully connected and registered, proceed to message publishing to ensure dependencies are rightly managed and the logic mimics the structured error-handling phase of ref FSM.\n\nBy embedding these changes, the current FSM can gain improved error handling, increased specificity in initialization and more seamless message protocol checks aligned with robust network communications."
