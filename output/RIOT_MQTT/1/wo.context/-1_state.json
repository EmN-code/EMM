Conversely, the current FSM transitions directly to ERROR following a connection failure (CONNECTION_FAIL). Furthermore, the reference FSM introduces distinct setup stages for the MQTT client, which are not explicitly represented in the current FSM.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n1. **Introduce Retry Logic:**\n   - Implement a retry mechanism for reconnect attempts to the MQTT broker. Upon CONNECTION_FAIL, transition to a state akin to CONNECT_BROKER_RETRY rather than directly jumping to ERROR. The state should feature transitions conditioned upon retry timer expirations (e.g., CONNECT_RETRY_TIMER_ELAPSED).\n\n2. **MQTT Client Initialization State:**\n   - Establish an explicit MQTT client initialization state (MQTT_CLIENT_SETUP in ref_FSMs) to systematically prepare the MQTT client prior to attempting connections. This can help segment tasks like setting client parameters, which may aid in more isolated debugging.\n\n3. **Error Handling Enhancements:**\n   - Instead of looping back to NETWORK_INIT from ERROR, consider revisiting the failed step with corrective strategies in place, like increasing log granularity or employing exponential backoff strategies."

            "prefix: This RIOT program is designed to run on the ESP32 and repeatedly publish the state ('\"work\"') to an MQTT broker at IP 47.102.103.1 and port 1883 every 5 seconds. The program achieves this through the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - It first initializes MQTT-SN connection details by setting the broker's address and port.\n   - Uses the `emcute_con` function to establish a connection to the MQTT broker.\n\n2. **Topic Registration**:\n   - The 'state' topic is registered using `emcute_reg`. The topic must be registered before publishing.\n\n3. **Publishing Loop**:\n   - A separate thread is created to publish the message 'work' at regular intervals.\n   - The `emcute_pub` function publishes the message to the specified topic with QoS 0.\n   - The loop uses the `xtimer_sleep` function to wait for 5 seconds (defined by constant `PUB_INTERVAL`) between each publication.\n\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - The main function remains active to keep the program running indefinitely. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"emcute.h\"\n#include \"net/ipv4/addr.h\"\n#include \"MQTTClient.h\"\n\n#define BROKER_IP \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define BROKER_PORT 1883\n#define PUB_INTERVAL (5LU * US_PER_SEC)  // Publish every 5 seconds\n\nstatic emcute_topic_t topic;\n\nvoid *publish_thread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while(1) {\n        const char *msg = \"work\";\n        printf(\"Publishing: %s\\n\", msg);\n        if (emcute_pub(&topic, msg, strlen(msg), EMCUTE_QOS_0) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n            puts(\"Error publishing\");\n        }\n        xtimer_sleep(PUB_INTERVAL / US_PER_SEC);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // MQTT-SN connection setup\n    sock_udp_ep_t gw = {.port = BROKER_PORT};\n    gw.family = AF_INET;\n\n    if (ipv4_addr_from_str((ipv4_addr_t *)&gw.addr.ipv4, BROKER_IP) == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Error parsing broker IP\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (emcute_con((sock_udp_ep_t *)&gw, true, NULL, NULL, 0, 0) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        puts(\"Error connecting to broker\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Topic registration\n    topic.name = \"state\";\n    if (emcute_reg(&topic) != EMCUTE_OK) {\n        puts(\"Error registering topic\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Start publish thread\n    char stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT];\n    thread_create(stack, sizeof(stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, 0,\n                  publish_thread, NULL, \"publish_thread\");\n\n    // Infinite loop to keep main thread alive\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(PUB_INTERVAL);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
