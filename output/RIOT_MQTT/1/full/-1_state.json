            "prefix: This solution describes a RIOT program for the ESP32 that connects to an MQTT broker using a specified IP address and port, and publishes a message every five seconds to report a state. We are not using the emcute library, but rather implement the MQTT protocol more directly using available RIOT capabilities. The code involves setting up a network connection, establishing an MQTT connection, and continuously publishing states in a loop. Exception handling is incorporated to ensure network reconnections when necessary, retrying every second until success for robust operation. The sequence involves MQTT initialization, connection, publishing, and then eventually disconnecting as part of safe cleanup operations.\n\nSince we need to handle potential connection failures robustly, we implement a loop to retry the connection if the initial attempt fails. This involves checking the return codes of network connection and MQTT client operations.\n\nThis code assumes you have configured support for your ESP32 and the necessary libraries for network operations and client operations are included in RIOT. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <net/mqtt.h>\n#include <net/network.h>\n\n#define MQTT_BROKER_IP    \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define MQTT_BROKER_PORT  1883\n#define MQTT_PUB_TOPIC    \"device/state\"\n#define MQTT_MSG_WORK     \"work\"\n#define MQTT_MSG_NOWORK   \"not work\"\n\nstatic char mqtt_sendbuf[128];\nstatic char mqtt_readbuf[128];\nMQTTClient client;\nNetwork network;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    int rc;\n    NetworkInit(&network);\n    MQTTClientInit(&client, &network, 1000, mqtt_sendbuf, sizeof(mqtt_sendbuf), mqtt_readbuf, sizeof(mqtt_readbuf));\n\n    while (1) {\n        rc = NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT);\n        if (rc != 0) {\n            printf(\"Network connection failed.
