The root cause of the error "fatal error: netdb.h: No such file or directory" is that the RIOT OS toolchain does not include a `<netdb.h>` header file, unlike a standard POSIX system. RIOT uses a different networking API tailored for constrained devices. This requires modifying the approach to network connections to fit within the RIOT ecosystem.

Here’s how we can resolve this:
1. Remove any POSIX networking headers and replace them with RIOT-specific headers where needed.
2. Implement network connections using RIOT's socket API via `sock_udp` for UDP-related tasks, as MQTT uses IP networking over TCP by default.
3. Include necessary headers in descending order by their first letter for any that are required by RIOT’s network and MQTT client libraries.
4. Include `MQTTClient.h` at the end of the include statement.
