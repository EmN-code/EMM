            "prefix: To solve the problem of connecting an ESP32 device to an MQTT broker using RIOT and publishing the state (\"work\" or \"not work\") every five seconds, we can utilize the Mosquitto library, which is a popular MQTT library in C. The process involves setting up the MQTT client, connecting to the specified broker, and publishing the state continuously in a loop. Here's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code to accomplish that.\n\n1. **Include Required Headers**: We include necessary headers for input-output operations and to use the Mosquitto library.\n\n2. **Define MQTT Parameters**: Define the MQTT broker's address, port, topic to publish to, and the client ID.\n\n3. **Global Variables**: Declare a boolean variable `work_state` to track whether the device is working or not, and a function `publish_state` to publish this state to the MQTT broker.\n\n4. **Initialize Mosquitto Library**: Initialize the Mosquitto library and create a new Mosquitto client instance.\n\n5. **Connect to MQTT Broker**: Use the Mosquitto function to connect to the broker specified by `MQTT_HOST` and `MQTT_PORT`.\n\n6. **Publish State in a Loop**: In the main program loop, publish the state every 5 seconds. The `sleep` function is used to delay the loop iteration by 5 seconds between each publish.\n\n7. **Cleanup**: Ensure to clean up by destroying the Mosquitto client and calling the Mosquitto library cleanup function.\n\nThis code manages the connection and communication with the MQTT broker effectively without the use of the emcute library. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <mosquitto.h>\n\n#define MQTT_HOST \"47.102.103.1\"\n#define MQTT_PORT 1883\n#define MQTT_TOPIC \"device/state\"\n#define MQTT_CLIENT_ID \"RIOT_ESP32\"\n\nstatic bool work_state = true;\n\nvoid publish_state(struct mosquitto *mosq) {\n    char message[20];\n    snprintf(message, sizeof(message), \"state: %s\", work_state ? \"work\" : \"not work\");\n    mosquitto_publish(mosq, NULL, MQTT_TOPIC, strlen(message), message, 0, false);\n    printf(\"Published: %s\\n\", message);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    struct mosquitto *mosq;\n\n    // Initialize the Mosquitto library\n    mosquitto_lib_init();\n\n    // Create a new Mosquitto client instance\n    mosq = mosquitto_new(MQTT_CLIENT_ID, true, NULL);\n    if (!mosq) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create Mosquitto client\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the specified MQTT broker\n    if (mosquitto_connect(mosq, MQTT_HOST, MQTT_PORT, 60) != MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Unable to connect to MQTT broker\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Loop to publish the device state every 5 seconds\n    while (1) {\n        publish_state(mosq);\n        sleep(5);\n    }\n\n    // Clean up Mosquitto library\n    mosquitto_destroy(mosq);\n    mosquitto_lib_cleanup();\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
