            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: **Current FSMs Pattern**\n- START -> CONNECT (on INITIALIZED) -> AUTHENTICATE (on CONNECT_OK) -> OPERATE (on AUTH_OK) -> RECONNECT (on DISCONNECT) -> CONNECT (on RECONNECT_OK)\n- Error handling in each stage leads to an ERROR state with a RESET condition to go back to START.\n\n**Reference FSMs Pattern**\n1. INIT -> NETWORK_INIT (on ztimer_sleep_complete) -> MQTT_INIT (on NetworkInit_OK) -> NETWORK_CONNECT (on MQTTClientInit_OK) -> MQTT_CONNECT (on NetworkConnect_OK) -> PUBLISH (on MQTTConnect_OK)\n2. Error Handling transitions back to INIT with a proper Error_Handler.\n3. IN case of connect fails: MQTT_CONNECT (on Network Initialized Successfully) can also be linked with ERROR state (on Network Initialization Failed).\n\n**Differences and Issues Identified:**\n1. Granular steps in `ref_FSMs` such as `INIT`, `NETWORK_INIT`, and `MQTT_INIT` are not present in `curr_FSMs`, which skips immediately to CONNECT and AUTHENTICATE.\n2. `ref_FSMs` describes a loop for publishing messages continually in MQTT_PUBLISH (or PUBLISH equivalent) on Publish_Interval, whereas `curr_FSMs` OPERATE does not mention such operation.\n3. Transition on failures in `ref_FSMs` goes back to `INIT` state while `curr_FSMs` transitions to an ERROR state, and all errors transition to a common error state directly rather than a specific stage restart that `ref_FSMs` specifies.\n4. `curr_FSMs` does not adequately handle retries in case of NETWORK or MQTT connectivity failures.\n\n**Corrective Measures:**\n1. Introduce states for initialization of the network and MQTT which align with `ref_FSMs` - adding states like INIT, NETWORK_INIT, MQTT_INIT before reaching to CONNECT.\n2. Implement a retry mechanism on failure of either network or MQTT connections, aligning like NETWORK_CONNECT transition handling in `ref_FSMs`.\n3. Implement a loopback mechanism for operations such as PUBLISH based on certain conditions similar to PUBLISH in `ref_FSMs`.\n4. Modify ERROR handling to potentially restart certain subsystems rather than a blanket restart mechanism by associating errors with more specific handling.`"
