The following code provides a complete example of how to connect to an MQTT broker and publish a message every five seconds using the specified APIs. The code includes the necessary headers, network initialization, and MQTT client details. We handle errors by retrying failed operations and use a simple loop to repeatedly publish messages.

```c
#include <ztimer.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <paho_mqtt.h>
#include <stddef.h>

#define MQTT_BROKER_IP "47.102.103.1"
#define MQTT_BROKER_PORT 1883
#define PUBLISH_INTERVAL 5

void *mqtt_publish_thread(void *arg) {
    (void)arg;
    int rc;
    Network network;
    MQTTClient client;
    unsigned char sendbuf[80], readbuf[80];
    MQTTPacket_connectData connectData = MQTTPacket_connectData_initializer;
    MQTTMessage message;

    // Initialize network
    NetworkInit(&network);

    // Initialize MQTT client
    MQTTClientInit(&client, &network, 1000, sendbuf, sizeof(sendbuf), readbuf, sizeof(readbuf));

    while (1) {
        // Try to connect to the network
        while ((rc = NetworkConnect(&network, MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT)) != 0) {
            printf("Network connect failed, retrying...\n");
            ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, 1000);
        }

        // Attempt to connect to the MQTT broker
        while ((rc = MQTTConnect(&client, &connectData)) != 0) {
            printf("MQTT connect failed, retrying...\n");
            ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, 1000);
        }

        printf("Connected to MQTT broker at %s:%d\n", MQTT_BROKER_IP, MQTT_BROKER_PORT);

        // Prepare the message
        message.qos = QOS0;
        message.retained = 0;
        message.payload = (void *)"work";
        message.payloadlen = strlen((const char *)message.payload);

        while (1) {
            // Publish the message
            if ((rc = MQTTPublish(&client, "topic/workstate", &message)) != 0) {
                printf("Publish failed, reconnecting MQTT...\n");
                break;  // break out to retry connecting
            }

            printf("Message published\n");
            ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, PUBLISH_INTERVAL);
        }

        // Disconnect from MQTT broker if publish fails
        NetworkDisconnect(&network);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(void) {
    // Create MQTT publish thread
    thread_create(stack, sizeof(stack), THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,
                  mqtt_publish_thread, NULL, "mqtt_publish");

    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes the network and MQTT client, connects to the broker, and repeatedly publishes messages every five seconds. It includes error checking and retries for both network and MQTT connections. If any operation fails, it will wait for one second before retrying. The message is published to the "topic/workstate" topic with the content "work" every time.
