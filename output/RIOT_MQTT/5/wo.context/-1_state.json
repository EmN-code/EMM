            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Error Analysis Report\n\n#### Observed Patterns:\n##### Current FSMs:\n1. **INIT State**\n   - If `mqtt_client_init_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n   - If `mqtt_client_init_OK`, transition to `CONNECT`.\n\n2. **CONNECT State**\n   - If `mqtt_connect_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n   - If `mqtt_connect_OK`, transition to `PUBLISH`.\n\n3. **PUBLISH State**\n   - Repeatedly publishes messages indefinitely.\n\n4. **ERROR State**\n   - No transitions defined, terminal state.\n\n##### Reference FSMs:\n1. **MQTT_CLIENT_SETUP**\n   - If `MQTT_CLIENT_INIT_OK`, transition to `CONNECT_MQTT`.\n   - If `MQTT_CLIENT_INIT_FAIL`, transition to `ERROR`.\n\n2. **CONNECT_MQTT**\n   - If `MQTT_CONNECT_SUCCESS`, transition to `PUBLISH`.\n   - If `MQTT_CONNECT_FAIL`, transition to `CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY`.\n\n3. **CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY**\n   - Waits for 'MQTT_RETRY_TIMER_ELAPSED' and retries connecting.\n\n#### Main Differences:\n- The `ref_FSMs` includes a retry mechanism for failed MQTT connections (`CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY`), which is missing in `curr_FSMs`.\n- The `curr_FSMs` does not handle network setup or initialization robustly (no `NETWORK_SETUP` or retry mechanism is included).\n\n#### Issues in Code Based on FSMs:\n1. **No Retry Mechanism for MQTT Connection:**\n   - In the current code, if the MQTT connection fails (`mqtt_connect_FAIL`), it transitions to the `ERROR` state immediately without retrying.\n\n2. **Endless Loop without Proper State Management:**\n   - The while loop in `PUBLISH` state could run forever without a clean exit strategy or transition to another state, particularly in real-world scenarios where connectivity issues could demand more robust error handling.\n\n#### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Implement Retry Mechanism:**\n   - Introduce a `CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY` state to handle the reconnection attempts after a failure. This state should trigger a retry after a set time delay.\n\n2. **Introduce Network Initialization State:**\n   - Although not detailed in the ref_FSMs for network initialization, ensuring a network setup state could avoid failures related to network configuration issues prior to MQTT initialization.\n\n3. **Define Clear Error Recovery Paths:**\n   - Rather than transitioning to a terminal `ERROR` state, provide a loop back to previous states where recovery actions can be attempted (like a retry from `ERROR` back to `CONNECT` after failures).\n\n4. **Graceful Loop Exit or Transition Management:**\n   - Ensure the `PUBLISH` state includes a strategy for stopping publication or switching to a shutdown mode under certain conditions."
