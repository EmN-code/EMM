            "prefix: This code demonstrates interrupt handling in Zephyr using atomic variables to verify the interruption and restoration functionality without using the GPIO interface. The program includes the relevant header files, defines an interrupt service routine (ISR) to handle an interrupt, and performs operations to lock and unlock the local interrupts.\n\nThe program logic is as follows:\n1. It begins by locking interrupts using `irq_lock()` to ensure that the critical section is not interrupted.\n2. It then connects and registers an ISR function `my_isr` to an interrupt vector (in this case, vector number 15 is used, which should be replaced with the actual interrupt vector needed based on your hardware setup).\n3. The ISR `my_isr` increments an atomic variable `irq_counter` each time it is called.\n4. Initially, the `irq_counter` is set to 0.\n5. Interrupts are then re-enabled using `irq_unlock()`.\n6. The program manually triggers the ISR by calling `my_isr` since the real hardware interrupt setup cannot be demonstrated in this example code. This simulates an interrupt event.\n7. Finally, it verifies that the `irq_counter` is incremented to ensure the ISR was executed and the interrupt was handled correctly, printing the result.\n\nNote: IRQ vector number and manually triggering for testing would need to be replaced with actual hardware acquisition in a physical application. \n block: #include <zephyr/types.h>\n#include <zephyr/toolchain.h>\n#include <zephyr/sys/util.h>\n#include <zephyr/kernel.h>\n#include <zephyr/device.h>\n#include <zephyr/init.h>\n\nvolatile atomic_t irq_counter;\n\n/* Define an interrupt service routine */\nvoid my_isr(const void *arg) {\n    ARG_UNUSED(arg);\n    atomic_inc(&irq_counter);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Disable local interrupts */\n    unsigned int key = irq_lock();\n\n    /* Register the interrupt handler for a test interrupt vector */\n    IRQ_CONNECT(15, 0, my_isr, NULL, 0);\n\n    /* Initialize the counter */\n    atomic_set(&irq_counter, 0);\n\n    /* Restore interrupts */\n    irq_unlock(key);\n\n    /* Simulate interrupt firing */\n    if (atomic_get(&irq_counter) == 0) {\n        my_isr(NULL);  // manually triggering interrupt for testing\n    }\n\n    /* Ensure the interrupt was handled */\n    if (atomic_get(&irq_counter) != 1) {\n        printk(\"Error: Interrupt handling failed!\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printk(\"Success: Interrupt handled correctly!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
