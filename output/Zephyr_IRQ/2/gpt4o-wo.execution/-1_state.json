            "prefix: The problem involves writing a Zephyr application for an ESP32 board to manage interrupts without using the GPIO interface. The solution should involve the use of irq and atomic variables to check the interrupt handling mechanism.\n\nHere's the approach to solve this problem:\n1. **Include necessary headers**: The code begins with including all the necessary Zephyr headers in the required alphabetical order as stated in the constraints.\n\n2. **Define necessary variables**: Define an atomic variable to check the occurrence of interrupts. Another variable is defined to store the key during irq lock/unlock operations.\n\n3. **Define the interrupt handler**: A simple function to act as an interrupt handler. It sets the atomic variable to indicate that the interrupt has occurred.\n\n4. **In `main()`**:\n   - Initialize the atomic variable.\n   - Use `irq_lock()` to disable interrupts and store the returned key.\n   - Simulate some operations while interrupts are disabled and manually call the interrupt handler to simulate an interrupt.\n   - Check if the interrupt was handled during the disabled state. It should not be handled as interrupts are disabled.\n   - Use `irq_unlock()` to restore the interrupts.\n   - Call the interrupt handler again to ensure it works correctly when the interrupts are enabled.\n\nThis code effectively tests the irq lock and unlock mechanism in Zephyr on an ESP32 platform. \n block: #include <zephyr/toolchain.h> \n#include <zephyr/types.h>\n#include <zephyr/kernel.h>\n#include <zephyr/sys/printk.h>\n\n/* Variable to hold the old interrupt lock key */\nunsigned int key;\n\n/* Atomic variable for interrupt status verification */\natomic_t interrupt_occurred;\n\n/* Interrupt handler function */\nvoid irq_handler(const void *param) {\n    atomic_set(&interrupt_occurred, 1);\n    printk(\"Interrupt occurred!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Initialize atomic variable */\n    atomic_set(&interrupt_occurred, 0);\n    \n    printk(\"Starting interrupt test on ESP32\\n\");\n    \n    /* Disable interrupts and save the key */\n    key = irq_lock();\n    printk(\"Interrupts disabled\\n\");\n    \n    /* Simulating some critical section */\n    k_sleep(K_MSEC(1000));\n    \n    /* Forcefully call the interrupt handler */\n    irq_handler(NULL);\n    \n    /* Check if interrupt was handled during disabled state */\n    if (!atomic_get(&interrupt_occurred)) {\n        printk(\"Interrupt was correctly deferred!\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printk(\"Unexpected interrupt occurrence!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    /* Restore interrupts */\n    irq_unlock(key);\n    printk(\"Interrupts restored\\n\");\n\n    /* Reset interrupt_occurred for second test */\n    atomic_set(&interrupt_occurred, 0);\n\n    /* Now enable interrupt and check again */\n    irq_handler(NULL);\n\n    if (atomic_get(&interrupt_occurred)) {\n        printk(\"Interrupt handled correctly after restoring!\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printk(\"Interrupt was not processed correctly!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
