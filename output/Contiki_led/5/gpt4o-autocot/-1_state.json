            "prefix: This Contiki code is designed to run on an NRF52840 platform. It consistently reads data from a DHT11 sensor every five seconds and uses this data to operate an RGB LED. The process involves initializing a timer for a 5-second interval, and within each cycle, the DHT11 sensor's readings for temperature and humidity are obtained. If the readings are successful, the RGB LED is turned on to signal that the sensor reading was effectively made. After a short delay, the RGB LED is turned off. The code is structured with proper inclusion of relevant header files arranged in descending order by their first letter as required. \n block: #include \"sensors_sensor.h\"\n#include \"netstack.h\"\n#include \"contiki-default-conf.h\"\n\nPROCESS(dht11_led_process, \"DHT11 and LED process\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&dht11_led_process);\n\nstatic struct etimer et;\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(dht11_led_process, ev, data)\n{\n  PROCESS_BEGIN();\n  \n  while (1) {\n    // Set timer for 5 seconds\n    etimer_set(&et, CLOCK_SECOND * 5);\n    \n    // Wait for the timer event\n    PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&et));\n\n    // Read the DHT11 sensor temperature and humidity\n    int temperature, humidity;\n    if (dht11_sensor.value(&temperature, &humidity) == 0) {\n      printf(\"Temperature: %d, Humidity: %d\\n\", temperature, humidity);\n\n      // Turn on the RGB LED\n      // Assume there is a function to control the RGB LED; pseudo-code given below:\n      rgb_led_on();\n      \n      // Keep the LED on for demonstration purposes or adjust as needed\n      clock_delay_usec(500000);\n      \n      // Turn off the RGB LED\n      rgb_led_off();\n    }\n  }\n\n  PROCESS_END();\n} \n"
