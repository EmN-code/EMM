            "prefix: This Contiki code is designed to run on an NRF52840 platform and continuously reads data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor every five seconds. When the sensor read operation is successful, it prints the temperature and humidity values to the console. Simultaneously, it turns on an RGB LED by activating its red, green, and blue components. The main process, `read_dht11_and_control_led`, is initiated at startup. It utilizes an etimer to create a periodic loop that triggers every five seconds. Within the loop, it attempts to read data from the DHT11 sensor. If the sensor read is successful, the RGB LED is turned on, and sensor values are printed; otherwise, an error message is outputted. Here are the essential imports and the complete code. \n block: #include \"contiki.h\"\n#include \"dev/leds.h\"\n#include \"dev/dht11.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nPROCESS(read_dht11_and_control_led, \"Read DHT11 and Control RGB LED\");\nAUTOSTART_PROCESSES(&read_dht11_and_control_led);\n\nPROCESS_THREAD(read_dht11_and_control_led, ev, data)\n{\n  static struct etimer timer;\n  static int temperature, humidity;\n\n  PROCESS_BEGIN();\n\n  while (1) {\n    // Set the timer for 5 seconds\n    etimer_set(&timer, CLOCK_SECOND * 5);\n\n    // Wait for the timer to expire\n    PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL(etimer_expired(&timer));\n\n    // Read the DHT11 sensor\n    if (dht11_read(&temperature, &humidity) == DHT11_OK) {\n      // Print the temperature and humidity values\n      printf(\"Temperature: %d\u00b0C, Humidity: %d%%\\n\", temperature, humidity);\n\n      // Turn on the RGB LED (assuming red, green, and blue can be turned on simultaneously)\n      leds_on(LEDS_RED);\n      leds_on(LEDS_GREEN);\n      leds_on(LEDS_BLUE);\n    } else {\n      printf(\"Failed to read from DHT11 sensor\\n\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  PROCESS_END();\n} \n"
