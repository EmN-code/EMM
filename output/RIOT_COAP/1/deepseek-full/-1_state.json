            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Pattern Extraction\n\n1. **Current FSM Pattern**:\n   - **Network Initialization:**\n     - Network initialized success leads to creating a CoAP message.\n     - Failure leads to retrying the network initialization.\n   - **Message Creation:**\n     - Successfully created message advances to sending it.\n     - Failure results in an error.\n   - **Message Sending:**\n     - Successfully sent message transitions to awaiting a response.\n     - Failure results in an error.\n   - **Response Handling:**\n     - Response received leads to processing it.\n     - Missing response requires retrying the message sending.\n   - **Response Processing:**\n     - Successful processing results in success.\n     - Failed processing leads to an error.\n\n2. **Reference FSM Patterns**:\n   - **Start and Request Process**:\n     - Parse server address success advances sending request.\n     - Failure leads directly to an error.\n   - **Response Tracking:**\n     - Response timeout or failure leads to an error.\n     - Successful response results in processing it.\n   - **Error Handling**: Exceptional cases suggest restarting from the start.\n\n### Analysis of Differences\n- **Redundancy in Error Handling**: \n  - The current FSM has a retry mechanism for both network initialization and message sending, while the reference FSM tends to move to an error state and restart the process.\n- **Error Transitions**:\n  - The reference FSM plans for errors by suggesting retries from the start, unlike the current FSM, which is focused more on retrying specific parts like network initialization and CoAP message sending.\n\n### Issues in the Current Code\n\n1. **Lack of Comprehensive Error Handling:**\n   - The current code lacks specific retry mechanisms and seems to loop indefinitely. Enhancing error detection and logging would lead to better debugging and analysis.\n\n2. **Missing Timeout Implementation**:\n   - No timeout mechanism in awaiting a response is present. If the response is not received, no alternative action is taken except for a passive retry (implicit through the infinite loop).\n\n3. **Retry Logic in Code**:\n   - As seen in the curr_FSMs, there's a retry loop for network and message sending operations which isn't explicitly handled in the code.\n   - Consider modifying the `xtimer_sleep(1);` with a condition checking the status (i.e., implementing counters or flags).\n\n4. **Missing Error Recovery Path**:\n    - In the code, in case of severe errors, the loop continues indefinitely without any exit strategy or recovery attempt.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n\n1. **Implement Timeouts and Retries**:\n   - Implement a timeout and a limited retry count for sending the request and waiting for the response. Use a counter to track the number of retries and decide when to stop retry attempts.\n   \n2. **Error Detection and Transition**:\n   - Add conditions to detect failures explicitly, such as network and server contact failures, and log them appropriately.\n\n3. **Explicit State Handling**:\n   - Use flags/conditions to transition from successful network initialization to subsequent steps accurately reflecting the FSM patterns more closely.\n   \n4. **Recovery Strategy:**\n   - Incorporate a resolution path when errors accumulate (e.g., restart system, notify maintenance, escalate issue, etc.).\n"
