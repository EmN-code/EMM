            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: ### Error Analysis Report\n\n#### Pattern Extraction\n\n1. **Current FSMs Pattern in curr_code**\n   - **INIT -> COAP_INIT**: The program begins and then initializes a CoAP request.\n   - **COAP_INIT -> WAIT_RESPONSE**: Upon a successful CoAP request send, it waits for a response.\n   - **WAIT_RESPONSE -> PROCESS_RESPONSE**: If it receives a response, it moves to process it.\n   - **PROCESS_RESPONSE -> SUCCESS/ERROR**: Depending on the validity of the response, it either logs success or encounters an error.\n   - **WAIT_RESPONSE -> RETRY**: If no response, retries unless maximum retries are reached.\n   - **RETRY -> COAP_INIT**: Retries a CoAP request send upon retry conditions.\n   - **RETRY -> ERROR**: Enters an error state if maximum retries are reached.\n   \n2. **Reference FSMs Pattern**\n   - **START -> NETWORK_SETUP**: Start the program and set up the network.\n   - **NETWORK_SETUP -> MQTT_CLIENT_SETUP/ERROR**: Initialize MQTT client or fail.\n   - **MQTT_CLIENT_SETUP -> CONNECT_MQTT/ERROR**: Attempt MQTT connection or fail.\n   - **CONNECT_MQTT -> PUBLISH/RETRY**: On successful connection publish messages or retry the connection if failed.\n   - **PUBLISH -> PUBLISH**: Continuous publishing upon a timer event.\n\n#### Differences in Patterns\n\n- **Network Initialization and Retry**: The ref_FSMs identify a specific retry mechanism and error handling paradigm for network and MQTT setup through distinct states and conditions, such as `CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY`. This pattern is robust due to its failure recovery mechanism, allowing multiple attempts before transitioning to an error state.\n- **CoAP Request Error Handling**: In curr_FSM, there isn't a dedicated initiate recovery mechanism for potential network issues or CoAP-specific retries akin to the structured retries in the reference FSM. It simply goes into an error state if the maximum retries are reached without a strategic transitional state indicating retry routines.\n\n#### Incorrect Matching Patterns\n\n1. The transition from WAIT_RESPONSE to RETRY in curr_FSMs lacks a pathway for a network recovery mechanism as suggested by the ref_FSMs which have transitions like CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY that iteratively attempts connections while managing state movement effectively.\n2. Lack of distinguished error states in curr_code that help diagnose between network issues and application logic.\n\n### Corrective Measures\n\n1. **Error Handling Expansion**:\n   - Implement a clear retry mechanism for the CoAP request similar to `CONNECT_MQTT_RETRY` in `ref_FSMs`. This will entail maintaining a connection state that initiates recovery upon failure.\n\n2. **Network Scoped Success and Error Management**:\n   - Implement states that distinctly manage network up and network down states, capturing retry attempts specifically related to network failures distinctively before general application failure states.\n\n3. **Modularizing CoAP Request Handling**:\n   - Enhance the CoAP request initiation and response handling to use a stateful mechanism that stores retry attempts centrally, perhaps using a counter system integrated into the state transitions to better control error management before escalating to a general error state."
