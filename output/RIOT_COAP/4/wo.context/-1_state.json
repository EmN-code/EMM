This is absent in the curr_FSMs.\n- **Request Retry Logic**: In the curr_FSMs, a failure in sending a request goes to `RETRY_SEND`, a separate state from `ERROR`, where in ref_FSMs a send failure directly leads to `ERROR`.\n- **Error Recovery**: In curr_FSMs, error leads back to `INIT` via a retry, whereas in ref_FSMs, error recovery can restart from `WIFI_INIT`. This might indicate a more robust and network-specific recovery path in ref_FSMs.\n\n\n### Correction Measures:\n1. **Init Network Connection**: Ensure network connection, specifically handling Wi-Fi setup before transitioning to send CoAP requests.\n2. **Direct Error Handling**: Consider merging `ERROR` handling paths to encompass retry strategies more effectively.\n3. **Verify PDU Initialization**: Emphasize managing both PDU and network initialization checks as done in ref_FSMs."

            "prefix: To solve the implicit declaration of the function error for 'inet_pton', you need to include the header file responsible for this function, which is part of the networking library. This error occurs because 'inet_pton' is not declared within the current scope, likely due to a missing include directive.
