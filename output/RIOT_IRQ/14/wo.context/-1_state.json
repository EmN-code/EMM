            "prefix: In this solution, we are developing a simple program for the ESP32 board to handle interrupts using RIOT's irq interface. The aim is to configure the program to use atomic operations to verify if disabling and restoring interrupts with `irq_disable` and `irq_restore` functions work correctly. Since gpio interface is not allowed, we'll simulate the interrupt handling directly within the code. The code includes an interrupt service handler that simply increments an atomic counter to simulate interrupt processing. The `main` function demonstrates disabling interrupts, manually invoking the interrupt handler, and then restoring the interrupts. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\natomic_uint interrupt_counter = 0;\n\n// Simulate an interrupt service routine that increments a counter\nvoid interrupt_handler(void) {\n    // Atomically increment the interrupt counter\n    atomic_fetch_add(&interrupt_counter, 1);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    unsigned state;\n\n    // Simulate disabling interrupts\n    state = irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled, state saved: %u\\n\", state);\n\n    // Simulate an interrupt occurring by manually invoking the handler\n    interrupt_handler();\n    printf(\"Interrupt handler called, counter: %u\\n\", interrupt_counter);\n\n    // Simulate restoring interrupts\n    irq_restore(state);\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored to state: %u\\n\", state);\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
