            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: The curr_FSMs can be distilled into the following pattern:\n1. Initialize Atomic Variable.\n2. Disable Interrupts.\n3. Modify Atomic Variable.\n4. Enable Interrupts.\n5. Simulate Interrupt.\n6. Verify Atomic Variable.\n7. Result Evaluation.\n8. Terminate.\n\nThe ref_FSMs display a pattern like:\n1. Start.\n2. IRQ Test Initialization.\n3. IRQ Test Successful or Failure path.\n4. Timer Set.\n5. Atomic Operation.\n6. Delay.\n7. Check Atomic Condition.\n8. Final Success or Failure.\n\nUpon analyzing the patterns between curr_FSMs and ref_FSMs:\n- The curr_FSMs lack steps for handling conditions such as timer initiation and delay which are present in the ref_FSMs.\n- The ref_FSMs include a more robust check for conditions with atomic variables during interrupt service routine (ISRs), which is missing in the curr_FSMs.\n- The curr_FSMs handle atomic variable verification directly after the interrupt without a delay phase as found in the ref_FSMs.\n\nIn terms of logic errors, the current code does not incorporate certain phases such as timer initiation and delay, which could lead to non-robust handling in ISR contexts. Consequently, the test may miss conditions observable only after a time delay or under specific interrupt conditions.\n\nCorrective Measures:\n1. Integrate a timer initiation step before verifying the atomic variable manipulation, following the pattern from the ref_FSMs effectively.\n2. Incorporate proper delay mechanisms and additional checks post-interrupt similar to the `Delay` and `Check Atomic Condition` states in the ref_FSMs.\n3. Extend the verification between atomic states during and outside ISRs to ensure handling integrity and prevent race conditions.\n4. Ensure robustness by handling failure paths and retry mechanisms during each significant transitional phase, especially during IRQ Test Initialization and Atomic Operations."
