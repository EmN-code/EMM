            "prefix: The solution involves creating a program to handle interrupts using atomic variables on an ESP32, without utilizing specific GPIO interfaces. The task is focused on testing the correct disabling and restoring of interrupts with the irq interface. This includes defining functions to disable, enable, and restore interrupts, as well as using an atomic-like approach with a volatile variable to store the state. The code is structured to ensure that it monitors state changes accurately within the framework of the pseudo implementation we are discussing for illustrative purposes. \n block: #include <irq_arch.h>\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Atomic variable for interrupt testing\nvolatile unsigned irq_state;\n\n// Function to enable an interrupt, using pseudo implementation \nstatic inline void enable_interrupt(void) {\n    // Code to enable interrupt\n    printf(\"Interrupt enabled.\\n\");\n}\n\n// Function to disable an interrupt and return its previous state, using pseudo implementation\nstatic inline unsigned disable_interrupt(void) {\n    // Pseudo code to disable the interrupt and set irq_state\n    unsigned state = irq_state;\n    irq_state = 0;\n    printf(\"Interrupt disabled.\\n\");\n    return state;\n}\n\n// Function to restore the interrupt to its previous state, using pseudo implementation\nstatic inline void restore_interrupt(unsigned state) {\n    irq_state = state;\n    printf(\"Interrupt restored.\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting interrupt handling test on ESP32.\\n\");\n\n    // Disabling interrupts\n    unsigned previous_state = disable_interrupt();\n\n    // Hypothetical test to illustrate the change in state\n    printf(\"Performing some operations while interrupt is disabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Restore the interrupt to its original state\n    restore_interrupt(previous_state);\n\n    // Final test to check the state\n    if (irq_state != 0) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt handling works correctly.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"There was a problem restoring interrupt state.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n} \n"
