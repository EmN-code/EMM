            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: **Current FSM Pattern:**\n1. INIT -> INTERRUPT_SIMULATE -> VERIFY_UPDATE -> SUCCESS_OUTPUT or FAIL_OUTPUT.\n\n**Reference FSM Pattern:**\n1. Start -> IRQ_TEST_INIT (Condition: complex conditions) -> IRQ_TEST_SUCCESS -> TIMER_SET ->...\n   - Interrupt testing involves multiple states like TIMER_SET, ATOMIC_OPERATION, DELAY, etc.\n2. There seems to be a network pattern involving socket creation and CoAP request.\n\n### Differences & Incorrect Matching Patterns:\n1. **Current FSM Pattern lacks Initial Checks:**\n   - The current FSM directly initializes and simulates interrupts without verifying initial conditions using appropriate flags or states like in the reference FSM, which checks states like `state_a and state_b` before proceeding.\n\n2. **Missing Timer Set Process:**\n   - In the reference FSM, there's an indication of a timer being initiated post interrupt initialization and testing. This isn't visible in the current FSM, leading to potential robustness issues as timers are common in IRQ handling scenarios.\n\n3. **No Delay Simulation:**\n   - The reference FSM indicates a `DELAY` state to provide time management in the IRQ operations. This type of delay for robust transition isn\u2019t visible in the current FSM.\n\n4. **Atomic Operation Integrity Checks:**\n   - While the current FSM performs atomic operations, it doesn\u2019t check for integrity as visible in the reference FSM which checks `atomic_load` conditions across ISR operations.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n1. **Integrate Initial State Check:**\n   - Introduce a verification step ensuring initial conditions are met before proceeding with the interrupt simulation, similar to the reference FSM system of `IRQ_TEST_INIT`.\n\n2. **Employ a Timer Mechanism:**\n   - Add a timer initiation post atomic store operations as shown in the reference FSM to manage ISR completion timing accurately.\n\n3. **Implement Delay Mechanism:**\n   - Extend the FSM to include a delay period, allowing synchronization checks which ensure atomic operations are fully managed.\n\n4. **Strengthen Atomic Integrity Checks:**\n   - Introduce checks post `atomic_load` that ensure the atomic operation integrity is maintained, similar to the multiple checks in `CHECK_ATOMIC_CONDITION` state in the reference FSM."
