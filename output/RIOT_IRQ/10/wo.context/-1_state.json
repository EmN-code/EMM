            "prefix: This code example demonstrates how to handle interrupts in RIOT OS for an ESP32 using atomic variables to verify if disabling and restoring interrupts work correctly. In this example, we utilize functions for disabling and restoring interrupts without interfacing with GPIO. This is achieved using the irq_disable() and irq_restore() functions. The demonstration includes disabling interrupts, performing a simulated busy operation, and then restoring interrupts. The steps are verified by printing the IRQ status at key points to the standard output. \n block: #include <irq_arch.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvolatile unsigned irq_status;\n\nvoid test_irq_disable_and_restore(void) {\n    irq_status = irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled. IRQ status: %u\\n\", irq_status);\n    \n    // Simulating some operation that requires interrupts to be disabled\n    unsigned busy_work = 0;\n    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {\n        busy_work += i;\n    }\n    \n    irq_restore(irq_status);\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored.IRQ status: %u\\n\", irq_status);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting IRQ test.\\n\");\n    test_irq_disable_and_restore();\n    printf(\"IRQ test completed.\\n\");\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
