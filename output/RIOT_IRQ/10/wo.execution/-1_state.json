            "prefix: The goal of this code is to handle interrupts using the RIOT OS on an ESP32 platform. We use atomic variables to verify if the enabling and disabling of interrupts work correctly. Particularly, we focus on the irq module without involving the GPIO interface.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Include Necessary Headers**: Headers are included in descending order. `irq_arch.h` is necessary for IRQ-based operations, and `stdatomic.h` is used for atomic variable support. Since RIOT OS may not support `stdatomic.h` directly, a custom approach or compatible header may be needed if issues arise.\n\n2. **Global Variables**: A volatile atomic boolean `irq_state` is declared to hold the interrupt status safely across operations.\n\n3. **Interrupt Handling Simulation**:\n   - Interrupts are disabled via `irq_disable()`, and the initial state is recorded and stored atomically.\n   - A critical section simulated by comments shows where real critical operations should take place.\n   - Interrupts are then restored using `irq_restore()`, with the state being stored again to represent the restored state.\n\n4. **Main Function**: Initializes the atomic variable and calls the function that simulates the interrupt handling, providing the console output for the state changes. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <irq_arch.h>  \n#include <inttypes.h> \n#include <stdatomic.h>\n\nvolatile atomic_bool irq_state;\n\nvoid simulate_interrupt_handling(void) {\n    // Disable interrupts and store the current state\n    unsigned state = irq_disable();\n    \n    // Setting atomic variable to verify the interrupts state\n    atomic_store(&irq_state, state);\n    \n    printf(\"Interrupts have been disabled. Current IRQ State: %u\\n\", state);\n\n    // Simulate critical section\n    // Perform operations that should not be interrupted\n\n    // Restore the previous interrupt state\n    irq_restore(state);\n    atomic_store(&irq_state, state);\n    \n    printf(\"Interrupts have been restored. IRQ State: %u\\n\", state);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize atomic variable\n    atomic_init(&irq_state, false);\n\n    // Simulate the interrupt handling process\n    simulate_interrupt_handling();\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
