            "prefix: This code demonstrates how to handle interrupts on an ESP32 using the RIOT operating system. It uses atomic variables to verify if disabling and enabling interrupts works correctly. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. **Header Inclusions**: The code imports the necessary header files in descending order by their first letter.\n2. **Setup Constants**: Defines the main thread's priority and stack size.\n3. **Atomic Variable**: Declares a static volatile variable `count` that will be incremented each time the interrupt is handled.\n4. **IRQ Handler**: Defines a simple IRQ handler function, `irq_handler`, that increments the `count` variable.\n5. **Main Function**: The entry point of the program where:\n   - `irq_handler` is registered.\n   - Interrupts are disabled using `irq_disable()`.\n   - Simulates a critical section using a simple loop, during which interrupts should be blocked.\n   - After the critical section, it verifies that the `count` hasn't increased (i.e., the interrupt hasn't been handled).\n   - Re-enables interrupts using `irq_enable()`.\n   - Waits for a set period to allow interrupts to be handled.\n   - Finally, it checks if the `count` variable has increased, indicating that interrupts are again being processed. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"ztimer.h\"\n#include \"irq.h\"\n\n#define MAIN_THREAD_PRIORITY (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n#define MAIN_THREAD_STACKSIZE (THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN)\n\nstatic volatile uint32_t count = 0;\n\n// Function that will be executed on interrupt\nvoid irq_handler(void) {\n    count++;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Register the IRQ handler\n    irq_handler_init(irq_handler);\n\n    // Disabling interrupts\n    irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Simulate work during which interrupts should be blocked\n    for (volatile int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++);\n\n    // Verifying that interrupt was not handled during the critical section\n    printf(\"Count should be 0: %u\\n\", count);\n\n    // Enabling interrupts\n    irq_enable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts enabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Allow some time for interrupt to occur\n    ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, 1000);\n\n    // Verifying that interrupt is handled after reenabling\n    printf(\"Count should be increased: %u\\n\", count);\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
