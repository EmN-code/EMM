            "prefix: This solution involves setting up a simple RIOT application to demonstrate how disabling and enabling interrupts can be performed using atomic operations on ESP32. This is achieved with RIOT's interrupt management capabilities, without using specific GPIO interfacing. Here is how the solution is structured:\n\n1. **Include Necessary Libraries**: Import `thread.h`, `irq_arch.h`, and `xtimer.h` for thread management, interrupt handling, and timer functionality.\n\n2. **Define Variables**: A global volatile atomic variable `irq_detected` is used to signal when an interrupt occurs.\n\n3. **Interrupt Handler**: The function `irq_handler` changes the atomic variable to simulate an interrupt being triggered.\n\n4. **Main Function**: \n    - Disable interrupts using `irq_disable()` and perform operations with interrupts turned off. \n    - Check if an interrupt was detected during the disabled phase.\n    - Restore the previous interrupt state with `irq_restore()`.\n    - Finally, simulate and check for interrupt detection again to verify that disabling and restoring functionalities work as expected. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n/**\n * This program demonstrates interrupt handling using RIOT's interrupt management.\n * It checks enabling and restoring interrupts using atomic variables.\n */\n\nvolatile bool irq_detected = false;\n\nvoid irq_handler(void) {\n    // Simulate an interrupt handler\n    irq_detected = true;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Disable interrupts and store the state\n    unsigned irq_state = irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled\\n\");\n\n    // Code that needs to run with interrupts disabled\n    if (irq_detected) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was detected while disabled\\n\");\n        irq_detected = false; // Clear the flag\n    }\n\n    // Restore the previous interrupt state\n    irq_restore(irq_state);\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored\\n\");\n\n    // After restoring, simulate an interrupt\n    irq_handler();\n\n    // Check if interrupt was detected after restoring\n    if (irq_detected) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was detected after restore\\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"No interrupt detected after restore\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
