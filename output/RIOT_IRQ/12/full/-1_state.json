            "prefix: To implement interrupt handling using atomic variables in a RIOT application for ESP32, we will create a simple program that disables and restores interrupts while verifying the behavior using atomic operations. We'll leverage RIOT's `irq_disable`, `irq_restore` to manage interrupts.\n\n1. **Description**:\n   - This program demonstrates how to handle interrupts in RIOT by disabling and restoring them, using atomic integers to verify if the operations succeed.\n   - We utilize functions from RIOT such as `irq_disable()` and `irq_restore()` to control the interrupts.\n   - Atomic variables help in ensuring consistent and safe updates to variables shared between interrupts and the main program loop.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Initialize an atomic variable.\n   - Disable the interrupts and perform some critical sections (modifying the atomic variable).\n   - Restore the interrupts and check if the atomic operations were correctly executed.\n\nMake sure to include header files for necessary functions such as `irq` handling and atomic operations in descending order alphabetically as specified. \n block: #include \"ztimer.h\"\n#include \"irq.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include <stdatomic.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\natomic_int irq_counter;\n\nvoid test_irq_handling(void) {\n    unsigned state = irq_disable();\n\n    // Critical section\n    atomic_fetch_add(&irq_counter, 1);\n    printf(\"IRQ disabled, counter incremented to %d\\n\", atomic_load(&irq_counter));\n\n    irq_restore(state);\n\n    // After restoring interrupts, check counter increment\n    printf(\"IRQ restored, final counter value is %d\\n\", atomic_load(&irq_counter));\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    atomic_init(&irq_counter, 0);\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        test_irq_handling();\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
