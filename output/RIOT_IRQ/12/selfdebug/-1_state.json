The warning states that there is a strict prototype requirement, and we need to avoid old-style function definitions. The solution involves implementing an example of interrupt handling using atomic variables in RIOT OS. This involves:\n\n1. Including the necessary RIOT API headers required for handling interrupts and timers (`irq_arch.h` and `ztimer.h`).\n2. Defining an interrupt handler that sets an atomic variable to indicate the interrupt occurred.\n3. Using the `irq_disable` and `irq_restore` functions to disable and restore interrupts while changing the atomic variable.\n4. Ensuring that all function declarations include a complete prototype as per C standards.\n5. Providing output messages to confirm whether interrupt handling and restoration worked correctly. \n block: #include \"ztimer.h\"\n#include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nstatic volatile bool interrupt_occurred = false;\n\nvoid interrupt_handler(void) {\n    interrupt_occurred = true;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Interrupt Handling Example with Atomic Variables\\n\");\n    \n    unsigned state;\n    \n    // Disable interrupts and save the current state\n    state = irq_disable();\n\n    // Simulate interrupt handling\n    interrupt_handler();\n\n    // Restore interrupts to previous state\n    irq_restore(state);\n\n    // Check if interrupt was handled\n    if (interrupt_occurred) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was successfully handled and restored.\\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was not handled correctly.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
