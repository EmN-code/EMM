            "You need to refer to the execution error analysis report: In the current code's FSM, the pattern is straightforward and involves:\n\n1. **INIT** -> **INTERRUPT_HANDLER_SET** - This involves disabling interrupts and setting an interrupt handler.\n2. **INTERRUPT_HANDLER_SET** -> **WAIT_FOR_INTERRUPT** - This involves enabling interrupts and waiting for one to occur.\n3. **WAIT_FOR_INTERRUPT** -> **HANDLE_INTERRUPT** - This occurs when an interrupt triggers, signaling that an interrupt has occurred.\n\nWhile the reference FSM pattern involves several checks and validation at different states, the current FSM lacks these critical verification steps. The reference FSM pattern includes steps like verifying interrupt state, checking specific conditions on atomic variables, and handling potential failures gracefully:\n\n1. **VERIFY_IRQ_STATE** - Ensures that certain conditions are met before proceeding, ensuring robustness and preventing potential erroneous states.\n2. **SUCCESS_PRINT/FAILURE_PRINT** - Provides additional stages for logging success or failure messages, which can be critical for debugging or monitoring purposes.\n3. **VERIFY_TEST_WORKS** - Another verification step analyzing the state of atomic variables during interrupts for consistency.\n4. **TEST_RESULT** - Analyzes deeper into the atomic variable states for deterministic results.\n5. **ERROR HANDLING** - Includes error transitions and handling, which is a crucial part of making a robust system.\n\n**Corrective Measures:**\n\n1. **Add Verification States:** Like 'VERIFY_IRQ_STATE' in the reference FSM, add states in the code to verify that the system conditions are consistent and transitions are logical before enabling interrupts.\n\n2. **Incorporate Error Handling:** Introduce error states similar to 'FAILURE_PRINT' and 'ERROR' in the reference FSM to handle any incorrect states smoothly. This helps in diagnosing and fixing potential issues effectively.\n\n3. **Perform Atomic Variable Checks:** Implement checks similar to 'VERIFY_TEST_WORKS' and 'TEST_RESULT' to ensure the system's atomic variables remain consistent and safe through interrupt handling.\n\n4. **Logging Success or Failure:** Implement success or failure prints like 'SUCCESS_PRINT'/'FAILURE_PRINT' states for better monitoring and debugging.\n\n5. **Ensure State Transition Completeness:** Ensure every state transition has a conceivable end point, akin to the 'END' state in the reference FSM, to maintain system integrity."
