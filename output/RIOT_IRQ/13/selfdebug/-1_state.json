After completing tasks that require interrupts to be disabled, the 'irq_enable' is called without any arguments to restore the interrupt only if it was originally enabled. This correction ensures proper use of the 'irq_{enable, disable}' functions within the RIOT system on the ESP32 platform, allowing for safe manipulation of atomic operations while maintaining system stability. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n\nunsigned irq_enable(void); // Declaration of irq_enable\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Atomic variable for verifying interrupt status.\n    volatile unsigned interrupt_status;\n    \n    // Disable interrupts and preserve the current state\n    interrupt_status = irq_disable();\n    \n    // Perform operations that require interrupts to be off\n    // Here, you can manipulate your atomic variable or perform sensitive tasks\n    \n    // Restore interrupt state using irq_enable\n    if (interrupt_status) {\n        irq_enable(); // Only call irq_enable if interrupts were previously enabled\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Main loop doing other tasks\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
