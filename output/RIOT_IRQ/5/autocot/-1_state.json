            "prefix: This code demonstrates handling interrupts using the irq functions provided by the RIOT operating system for an ESP32 device. It makes use of irq_disable, irq_is_disabled, and irq_restore, which are functions designed to manage interrupt states for critical sections of code. The sequence is important to ensure that critical operations are not interrupted by disabling interrupts, running the necessary critical operations, and then restoring interrupts to their previous state. This is a typical approach to managing low-level hardware operations safely in embedded systems. \n block: #include <irq_arch.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Disable interrupts\n    unsigned irq_state = irq_disable();\n    \n    // Critical section of code where interrupts need to be disabled\n    // Verify the state of irq (though in real scenarios you would execute your critical code here)\n    if (irq_is_disabled()) {\n        // Simulate critical operation\n        // Atomic operations or sensitive code section could run here\n    }\n    \n    // Restore interrupts to previous state\n    irq_restore(irq_state);\n    \n    // Optionally, check if interrupts are enabled again (for demonstration purposes)\n    if (!irq_is_disabled()) {\n        // Operation after restoring interrupts\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
