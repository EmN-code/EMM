            "prefix: To develop code for an ESP32 using the RIOT OS that demonstrates interrupt handling with atomic variables, you need to write a program that disables and enables interrupts while checking if an interrupt is properly handled using an atomic variable. This program will simulate interrupt handling in software without using any specific GPIO interface. Below is the code that achieves this: The code includes the necessary headers for atomic operations and interrupt control, a main function to control the flow of the program, and an interrupt service routine (ISR) that updates an atomic variable. The program first disables interrupts, simulates an interrupt, and checks if it was handled. It then re-enables interrupts, simulates another interrupt, and checks again. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdatomic.h>\n#include <irq.h>\n\n// Initialize an atomic variable to verify interrupt disable/restore\natomic_bool interrupt_handled = ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(false);\n\n// Interrupt handler function\nvoid esp32_isr(void) {\n    // Set atomic variable to true to indicate ISR execution\n    atomic_store(&interrupt_handled, true);\n    printf(\"Interrupt handled!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Disable interrupts\n    irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Simulate external event triggering an interrupt\n    // In an actual application, this would be triggered by hardware\n    esp32_isr();\n\n    // Check if the interrupt was handled during disabled state\n    if (atomic_load(&interrupt_handled)) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was handled while interrupts were disabled.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was not handled as expected.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // Re-enable interrupts\n    irq_enable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts enabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Reset atomic variable\n    atomic_store(&interrupt_handled, false);\n\n    // Simulate another interrupt now that interrupts are enabled\n    esp32_isr();\n\n    // Check again if the interrupt was handled\n    if (atomic_load(&interrupt_handled)) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was handled after re-enabling interrupts.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Interrupt was not handled after enabling interrupts.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
