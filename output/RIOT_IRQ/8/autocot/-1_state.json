            "prefix: This program is developed to run on RIOT OS for an ESP32 to demonstrate the handling of interrupts without using the GPIO interface. It uses atomic variables to verify the process of disabling and restoring interrupts via the RIOT irq API. The primary goal is to ensure that when interrupts are disabled, no interrupt should occur, and after enabling, the interrupt status is restored correctly.\n\nHere is the solution in the form of a C program: The program includes necessary headers, defines an atomic variable to track the state of interrupt, and implements a main function to handle the sequence of disabling and enabling interrupts using the RIOT platform functions for interrupt control. The program first checks if interrupts are enabled, disables them, simulates an interrupt, and restores them to the previous state. The success of each operation is validated by checking the status of the atomic variable and printed results. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <irq_arch.h>\n\nvolatile bool interrupt_occurred = false;  // Atomic variable to track the interrupt state\n\nvoid handle_interrupt(void) {\n    // Simulate an interrupt occurring\n    interrupt_occurred = true;\n    printf(\"Interrupt occurred!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting interrupt handling example.\\n\");\n    \n    // Initially, interrupts are enabled\n    bool initially_enabled = irq_is_enabled();\n    printf(\"Interrupts initially enabled: %d\\n\", initially_enabled);\n    \n    // Disable interrupts and store the state\n    unsigned irq_state = irq_disable();\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Trigger a simulated interrupt\n    handle_interrupt();\n\n    if (interrupt_occurred) {\n        printf(\"Interrupt handling failed!
