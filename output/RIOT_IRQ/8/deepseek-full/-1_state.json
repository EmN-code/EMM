This is implemented in the code (`interrupt_handled = false;`), but the FSM representation in the `curr_FSMs` does not explicitly show an initialization step as the first state, unlike the `ref_FSMs`.\n\n2. **Action and Transition Details**:\n   - **Current FSM**: Directly calls `simulate_interrupt()` which performs both the interrupt simulation and the handler call.\n   - **Reference FSM**: Separates the interrupt simulation (`INTERRUPT_SIMULATE`) from the handler call action (`INTERRUPT_HANDLER_CALL`). This separation is more granular and potentially more robust.\n\n3. **Verification Logic**:\n   - **Current FSM**: Verification based on a simple boolean check `interrupt_handled == true` or `false`.\n   - **Reference FSM**: Checks for `ATOMIC_LOAD_SUCCESS` or failure, which implies using atomic operations to load the state more safely.\n\n### Corrective Measures for Code\n1. **State Initialization**: Ensure the FSM represents the initialization explicitly. Update the FSM in the documentation to start with an explicit initialization step (from **INITIAL** to **INTERRUPT_SIMULATE**).\n\n2. **Granularity in Actions**: Consider separating interrupt simulation and handling into distinct actions both in the code and FSM. This could enhance readability and robustness by ensuring that actions are atomic and traceable.\n\n3. **Use Atomic Operations**: Implement atomic load and store operations for verifying the `interrupt_handled` state, to align with the reference pattern's use of atomic operations and improve code robustness. This would entail using atomic library functions instead of simple boolean operations."
