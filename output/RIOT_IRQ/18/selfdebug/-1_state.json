            "prefix: The program aims to handle interrupts on an ESP32 microcontroller using the RIOT operating system. It uses atomic operations to check if disabling and restoring interrupts are working correctly without using the gpio interface. The program includes relevant RIOT system header files in alphabetical order to ensure correct compilation and usage of functions. \n\nThe code initializes by checking if interrupts are enabled. It then disables interruptions and validates the process. After that, it restores the interrupts to their previous state and checks again if the restoring was successful. The whole test is encapsulated in the `test_irq` function, which is called in the `main` function. Below is the solution to fix the errors and execute the program correctly. \n block: #include \"thread_arch.h\"\n#include \"thread_flags.h\"\n#include \"irq_arch.h\"\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n\nvolatile unsigned irq_enabled;\n\nvoid test_irq(void) {\n    // Check if interrupts are enabled\n    if (!irq_is_enabled()) {\n        puts(\"IRQ is not enabled but required\");\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Disable IRQ and check\n    volatile unsigned previous_state = irq_disable();\n    if (irq_is_enabled()) {\n        puts(\"Failed to disable IRQ\");\n    } else {\n        puts(\"IRQ successfully disabled\");\n    }\n\n    // Restore IRQ and check\n    irq_restore(previous_state);\n    if (irq_is_enabled()) {\n        puts(\"IRQ successfully restored\");\n    } else {\n        puts(\"Failed to restore IRQ\");\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    puts(\"Starting interrupt handling test\");\n    \n    test_irq();\n    \n    return 0;\n} \n"
