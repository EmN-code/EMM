            "prefix: This example demonstrates how to implement interrupt handling in RIOT on an ESP32 without using the GPIO interface. We utilize the irq_arch.h header for interrupt handling functions available in RIOT-OS.\n\n1. Header Files: We include 'irq_arch.h' for handling interrupts and 'stdio.h' for printing the results to the console.\n2. Global Variables: We define two volatile global variables:\n   - 'irq_status' to store the interrupt status.\n   - 'global_count' to keep track of an operation that is affected by interrupts.\n3. Interrupt Handler: 'example_interrupt_handler' simulates an interrupt handler where:\n   - We disable interrupts using 'irq_disable()' and store the status in 'irq_status'.\n   - Increment 'global_count' as an example operation in a critical section.\n   - Restore interrupts using 'irq_restore(irq_status)'.\n4. main Function: This initializes the process:\n   - It simulates the operation before and after the interrupt by printing the counter values.\n   - In an actual embedded scenario, the interrupt handler will be called by the hardware when an interrupt occurs.\n\nThis code demonstrates basic interrupt handling by simulating an interrupt handler call and showing how the count is affected by the critical section controlled using interrupt disable/restore. \n block: #include <stdio.h>\n#include <irq_arch.h>\n\nvolatile unsigned irq_status;\nvolatile unsigned global_count = 0;\n\nvoid example_interrupt_handler(void) {\n    // Critical section starts\n    irq_status = irq_disable();\n\n    // Perform some operations\n    global_count++;\n\n    // Restore interrupts\n    irq_restore(irq_status);\n    // Critical section ends\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting interrupt handling example on ESP32 using RIOT OS.\\n\");\n\n    // Initial count before interrupt\n    printf(\"Initial Count Value: %u\\n\", global_count);\n\n    // Simulate an interrupt - in a real system, the handler would be triggered by hardware\n    example_interrupt_handler();\n    \n    // Count after interrupt\n    printf(\"Count Value after Interrupt: %u\\n\", global_count);\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
