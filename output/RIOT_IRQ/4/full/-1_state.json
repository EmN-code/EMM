This suggests a simple sequence of starting, checking interrupts, performing critical operations, and checking states before ending.\n   - There are no network or MQTT operations.\n\n2. **Reference FSMs Patterns (ref_FSMs):**\n   - There is a significant emphasis on network initialization, MQTT connection, and handling potential errors related to these operations.\n   - The ref_FSMs include states such as `NETWORK_INIT`, `CONNECT_BROKER`, and handling various success and failure conditions.\n   - There are transitions for error recovery such as retries (`NETWORK_RETRY`) and a robust handling of MQTT operations.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- The curr_FSMs lacks any states or transitions related to network or MQTT operations, which are prevalent in the ref_FSMs.\n- There is no handling of failure conditions or retries in the curr_FSMs.\n- The curr_FSMs end the process after a simple check post operations, missing the continuous loop for retrying and managing potential errors, unlike in ref_FSMs.\n\n### Identified Issues:\n- **Simplistic Logic:** The curr_FSMs are overly simplistic and lack robust error handling. There are no transitions for operation failure or retries.\n- **Absence of Network/MQTT Logic:** Unlike ref_FSMs, the curr_FSMs do not cover initializing and managing network or MQTT connections, which might be crucial depending on the application's context.\n\n### Corrective Measures:\n\n1. **Integrate Network and MQTT Operations:**\n   - Introduce states and transitions for network initialization and MQTT connections if applicable to the application context.\n   - Implement transitions for both successful and failure scenarios, including connection retries.\n\n2. **Implement Robust Error Handling:**\n   - Add states for managing errors and allow retries/recovery from network or MQTT initialization failures.\n\n3. **Continuous Loop for Operations:**\n   - Consider an ongoing loop that allows for repeated operations (e.g., publishing data) and handling reconnections if errors persist.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the FSM in the curr_code can be improved significantly to provide a more robust and comprehensive solution akin to the provided ref_FSMs."

            "prefix: The following solution demonstrates how to handle interrupts using the RIOT operating system on an ESP32 platform. It uses the `irq_disable()` and `irq_restore()` functions to manage interrupts during critical execution parts. The code includes necessary header files for handling network operations and an MQTT client based on the requirements. Each header file is included in descending order by their first letter, maintaining the alphabetical order.\n\nThis program sets up a basic environment where the interrupt is disabled during a critical operation section and then restored. This ensures that critical operations are carried out without interference and that the system safely re-enables interrupts afterward. The use of `printf()` indicates the progress of the execution. \n block: #include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n#include \"stdbool.h\"\n#include \"paho_mqtt.h\"\n#include \"net/sock/util.h\"\n#include \"net/sock/udp.h\"\n#include \"net/gcoap.h\"\n#include \"net/emcute.h\"\n#include \"mma8x5x.h\"\n#include \"mma8x5x_regs.h\"\n#include \"msg.h\"\n#include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include \"irq.h\"\n#include \"dht_params.h\"\n#include \"arpa/inet.h\"\n#include \"MQTTClient.h\"\n#include \"stdlib.h\"\n#include \"string.h\"\n\n// Function to simulate interrupt handling on an ESP32\nvoid handle_interrupt(void) {\n    unsigned state;\n    // Disable the interrupts\n    state = irq_disable();\n    // Simulate some critical section operations\n    printf(\"Handling interrupt, critical operations in progress...\\n\");\n    // Restore the interrupts\n    irq_restore(state);\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored.\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting the ESP32 Interrupt Handling Example\\n\");\n    handle_interrupt();\n    return 0; // Program successfully executed\n} \n"
