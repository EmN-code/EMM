            "prefix: To develop RIOT code for interrupt handling using an ESP32, we create a simple example where we simulate an interrupt and handle it using atomic variables and the irq functions provided by RIOT. This code demonstrates disabling interrupts, simulating an interrupt event, handling the interrupt, and finally restoring interrupts to ensure the correct behavior.\n\nFirst, we include necessary headers: `irq.h` for interrupt control, `atomic` for atomic operations, and other standard headers such as `stdio.h` for input/output and `xtimer.h` if we need timing functions in a broader context.\n\nWe declare an atomic boolean `interrupt_occurred` to check if an interrupt has occurred and been handled properly.\n\nThe function `handle_interrupt` simulates the interrupt handling by setting `interrupt_occurred` to true and printing a message.\n\nIn the `main` function, we demonstrate the flow of disabling interrupts using `irq_disable`, calling the interrupt handler, and then restoring interrupts with `irq_restore`. We check the value of `interrupt_occurred` before and after restoring interrupts to verify that the interrupts are disabled and restored correctly.\n\nThis program doesn't interface with a real interrupt source or GPIO, fulfilling the requirement without directly interacting with GPIOs. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdatomic.h>\n#include <irq.h>\n\natomic_bool interrupt_occurred = false;\n\nvoid handle_interrupt(void) {\n    atomic_store(&interrupt_occurred, true);\n    printf(\"Interrupt occurred!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Interrupt Handling Example on RIOT with ESP32\\n\");\n    \n    unsigned state = irq_disable();  // Disable interrupts\n    \n    handle_interrupt(); // Simulated interrupt handling\n\n    if (atomic_load(&interrupt_occurred)) {\n        printf(\"Interruption was successfully handled.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    irq_restore(state); // Restore interrupts\n\n    if (!atomic_load(&interrupt_occurred)) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts successfully restored and no new interrupt occurred.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
