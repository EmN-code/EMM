            "prefix: In this solution, we will develop a RIOT code for interrupt handling on an ESP32 without using the GPIO interface. We will make use of irq functions to disable and enable interrupts and verify the state with atomic variables. This is an essential mechanism in real-time operating systems like RIOT, as it helps in managing the processor's attention to critical tasks by controlling interruptions.\n\n1. First, we include the necessary RIOT header files such as `irq_arch.h` for interrupt handling functions.\n2. We define an atomic variable that will keep track of whether interrupts are enabled or disabled.\n3. In the `main` function, we will:\n  - Disable interrupts using `irq_disable`.\n  - Modify the atomic variable to reflect the disabled state.\n  - Re-enable interrupts using `irq_restore`.\n  - Modify the atomic variable back to enabled state.\n4. This verification process will help ensure that the irq functions are correctly handling the intended tasks of disabling and restoring interrupts.\n\nHere is the complete code setup including imports and execution block. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n/* Global atomic variable to track interrupt status */\nvolatile bool interrupts_enabled = true;\n\n/* Function to simulate the critical section */\nvoid critical_section(void) {\n    printf(\"Entering critical section. Disabling interrupts.\\n\");\n    unsigned state = irq_disable();    // Disable interrupts\n    interrupts_enabled = false;\n    \n    // Perform critical tasks\n    printf(\"Critical section performed with interrupts disabled.\\n\");\n\n    printf(\"Re-enabling interrupts.\\n\");\n    irq_restore(state);                // Restore interrupts\n    interrupts_enabled = true;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"RIOT ESP32 Interrupt Handling Example\\n\");\n\n    // Check initial interrupt state\n    if (interrupts_enabled) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts are initially enabled.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Interrupts are not enabled as expected.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // Invoke critical section to test irq functions\n    critical_section();\n\n    // Verify final interrupt state\n    if (interrupts_enabled) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts were successfully restored.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Interrupts are not restored as expected.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
