            "prefix: To achieve interrupt handling on an ESP32 without using the GPIO interface, you can utilize low-level interrupt functions provided by the RIOT OS, such as irq_disable and irq_restore. These functions allow you to disable and later restore interrupt handling, thereby allowing certain sections of your code to operate without interruptions. Here is how you can implement a simple RIOT program to test the irq functions:\n\n1. Include the necessary headers. In this case, you'll need `irq_arch.h` for using interrupt functions.\n2. Define a volatile boolean variable to track the interrupt status.\n3. Implement a function `test_irq_functions()` to disable interrupts, perform some operations, and then restore interrupts.\n4. The `main` function executes the test function, demonstrating the enable and disable functionality.\n5. Print statements are used for indicating the state of interrupts. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvolatile bool irq_disabled = false;\n\nvoid test_irq_functions(void) {\n    printf(\"Disabling IRQs.\\n\");\n    unsigned state = irq_disable();\n    irq_disabled = true;\n    \n    printf(\"IRQ Disabled: %d\\n\", irq_disabled);\n\n    // Do some critical operations here that you do not want to be interrupted\n\n    printf(\"Restoring IRQs.\\n\");\n    irq_restore(state);\n    irq_disabled = false;\n\n    printf(\"IRQ Restored: %d\\n\", irq_disabled);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Testing IRQ Disable/Restore\\n\");\n    test_irq_functions();\n    return 0;\n} \n"
