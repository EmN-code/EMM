It continuously checks the status of interrupts, disabling them and then restoring them, while printing out the success of each operation.\n\nHere are the steps involved in the code:\n1. **Included Libraries**: Include necessary libraries for handling interrupts and accessing RIOT functionality.\n2. **Global Variable**: Define a `volatile bool` variable `irq_status` to store the status of interrupts, ensuring atomic access.\n3. **Function `test_interrupt_handling`**: This function performs the following:\n   - Disable interrupts using `irq_disable()` and checks if they were successfully disabled.\n   - Restore interrupts using `irq_restore()` and checks if they were successfully enabled again.\n   - Print status messages to indicate success or failure.\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - Prints an introductory message.\n   - Enters an infinite loop where it calls `test_interrupt_handling()` and sleeps for a second, allowing continuous monitoring and testing of the interrupt handling. \n block: #include \"nvs_flash.h\"\n#include \"nimble/nimble_npl.h\"\n#include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nvolatile bool irq_status;\n\nvoid test_interrupt_handling(void) {\n    unsigned state;\n    printf(\"Disabling interrupts...\\n\");\n    state = irq_disable();\n    irq_status = irq_is_enabled();\n    if (!irq_status) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts are disabled successfully.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Failed to disable interrupts.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Restoring interrupts...\\n\");\n    irq_restore(state);\n    irq_status = irq_is_enabled();\n    if (irq_status) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts are enabled successfully.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Failed to enable interrupts.\\n\");\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Running RIOT on ESP32 with interrupt handling...\\n\");\n\n    while (1) {\n        test_interrupt_handling();\n        sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
