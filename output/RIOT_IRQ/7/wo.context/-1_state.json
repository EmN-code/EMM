            "prefix: This solution demonstrates how to handle interrupts on an ESP32 using RIOT-OS with atomic operations, specifically without using the GPIO interface. The program uses an atomic variable to verify if disabling and restoring interrupts works correctly. The `irq_disable` function is used to disable interrupts and save the current state, and `irq_restore` is used to restore interrupts. The atomic variable is incremented within a critical section to ensure the operation is not interrupted. This example includes necessary header files like `xtimer.h` for supporting time-related functions, `stdlib.h` for standard functions, and `irq_arch.h` for the interrupt functions and definitions. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>  // Include for timer functionalities\n#include <stdlib.h>   // Include for standard library \n#include <irq_arch.h> // Include for irq functionalities\n\nstatic volatile unsigned int atomic_var = 0;  // Define a volatile atomic variable\n\nvoid thread_func(void) {\n    unsigned state;\n    \n    /* Disable interrupts and save the current state */\n    state = irq_disable();\n    \n    /* Critical section: Modify the atomic variable */\n    atomic_var++;\n\n    /* Restore interrupts to previous state */\n    irq_restore(state);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Simulate interrupt handling by calling the function */\n    thread_func();\n    \n    /* Check if the atomic operation was successful */\n    if (atomic_var == 1) {\n        // Success: Print a message\n        puts(\"Interrupt handling with atomic operation is successful.\");\n    } else {\n        // Failure: Print a message\n        puts(\"Interrupt handling with atomic operation failed.\");\n    }\n    \n    return 0;  \n}\n \n"
