            "prefix: This program demonstrates handling interrupts on an ESP32 using RIOT OS without relying on the GPIO interface. It utilizes atomic operations to test the disabling and restoring of interrupts. The primary function of this code is to:\n\n1. Initialize variables `test_var` and `check_var` to verify atomic operations during interrupt states.\n2. Disable interrupts using `irq_disable()`, modify an atomic variable `test_var`, and store its state in `check_var`.\n3. Log the status of the interrupt disabling.\n4. Restore the interrupts to their previous state using `irq_restore()`.\n5. Verify and print the result of the atomic operation to ensure correctness.\n\nSpecifically, it includes the `irq_arch.h` header for interrupt handling operations in RIOT. The includes are sorted in descending order alphabetically by the first letter, as per the constraints provided. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initial setup\n    unsigned irq_status;\n    unsigned test_var = 0;\n\n    // Step 1: Disable interrupts and modify the atomic variable\n    irq_status = irq_disable();  // Disable interrupts\n    test_var += 1;  // Modify a variable atomically\n    unsigned check_var = test_var; // Copy for checking\n\n    // Step 2: Check if interrupts were successfully disabled\n    if (irq_status != 0) {\n        printf(\"Interrupts disabled successfully.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Failed to disable interrupts.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // Step 3: Re-enable interrupts\n    irq_restore(irq_status);\n\n    // Check if variable modification was successful\n    if (check_var == test_var) {\n        printf(\"Atomic operation successful.
