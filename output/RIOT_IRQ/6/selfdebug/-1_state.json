As evident from the documentation, this function likely requires some parameters which were omitted in the initial call. \n\nThe following code demonstrates the correct usage of irq functions to handle interrupts. It includes enabling, disabling, and restoring interrupts using atomic variables to ensure critical sections are handled correctly in RIOT-OS on an ESP32. The necessary header files are included in descending alphabetical order by their first letter.\n\nWe'll correct the function call and ensure all usage respects the API contracts as per the documentation provided. \n block: #include <assert.h> // Including in descending order by first letter\n#include <irq_arch.h> // Required for IRQ handling functions\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Initialize an atomic variable\nvolatile int irq_state;\nvolatile int critical_section = 0;\n\nvoid critical_task(void) {\n    // Simulating a task that needs interrupt protection\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        printf(\"Executing critical task iteration %d\\n\", i);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Enable interrupts and save previous state\n    irq_state = irq_enable();\n    \n    // Some code that runs with interrupts enabled\n    printf(\"Running with interrupts enabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Disable interrupts\n    irq_disable();\n    \n    // Simulate critical section\n    if (critical_section == 0) {\n        critical_section = 1;\n        critical_task();\n        critical_section = 0;\n    }\n\n    // Restore interrupts to previous state\n    irq_restore(irq_state);\n\n    // Confirm rest of the program runs\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored, exiting program.\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
