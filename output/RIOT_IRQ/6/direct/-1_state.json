            "prefix: This program is written to demonstrate interrupt handling in RIOT on an ESP32 without using a GPIO interface. Instead, it uses atomic variables to detect and handle interrupts. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Includes and Definitions**: Necessary headers are included to manage interrupts, threading, and timers. The program defines stack sizes and priorities for a thread.\n2. **Atomic Variable**: A global atomic variable `interrupt_occurred` is initialized to 0 and is used to check if an interrupt happened.\n3. **Thread Function**: A separate thread function `myThread` is used to periodically check if an interrupt has occurred while the interrupts were disabled. It prints a notification if the condition is met and resets the variable.\n4. **IRQ Handler**: The interrupt handler `irq_handler` sets `interrupt_occurred` to 1 to signal that an interrupt has occurred.\n5. **Main Function Setup**:\n   - Initializes and runs a thread to handle interrupt checks.\n   - Enables interrupts globally with `irq_enable()`.\n   - Simulates an interrupt for demonstration purposes by directly calling the `irq_handler` function.\n   - An infinite loop with a sleep timer keeps the program running.\n\nThe code ensures that the state of interrupts is correctly handled using atomic operations, checking for interrupts safely within the thread function. \n block: #include <xtensa/hal.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include \"xtimer.h\"\n\n#define STACKSIZE  (THREAD_STACKSIZE_DEFAULT)\n#define PRIO       (THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1)\n\nstatic char thread_stack[STACKSIZE];\natomic_t interrupt_occurred = ATOMIC_INIT(0);\n\nvoid *myThread(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(5);\n        printf(\"Checking interrupts...\\n\");\n        int was_disabled = xtensa_int_enable();\n        if (atomic_read(&interrupt_occurred) == 1) {\n            printf(\"Interrupt was handled while interrupts were disabled!\\n\");\n            atomic_set(&interrupt_occurred, 0);\n        }\n        xtensa_int_disable();\n\n        if (was_disabled) {\n            xtensa_int_restore(was_disabled);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void irq_handler(void *arg) {\n    (void)arg;\n    atomic_set(&interrupt_occurred, 1);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    puts(\"RIOT Interrupt Handling Example\");\n\n    thread_create(thread_stack, sizeof(thread_stack), PRIO, 0, myThread, NULL, \"myThread\");\n\n    irq_enable(); // or specific irq_enable(N);\n    // Simulate an interrupt by calling the handler directly\n    irq_handler(NULL);\n\n    while (1) {\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
