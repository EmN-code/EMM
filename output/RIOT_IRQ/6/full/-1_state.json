            "prefix: In this solution, we will focus on handling interrupts in an ESP32 using the RIOT operating system without involving GPIO interfaces as per the given constraint. We will use the `irq` API provided by RIOT for this purpose. The key steps will involve:\n\n1. **Disable interrupts:** Using `irq_disable()` function to ensure atomic operations can be performed safely.\n2. **Enable interrupts:** Using `irq_enable()` to restore the interrupt state after completing the critical section.\n3. **Verify with Atomic Operations:** Use a variable to check that interrupts have been disabled and restored correctly.\n\nThe program should carefully handle status checks to ensure that interrupt states are toggled correctly without causing undefined behavior in the system. Here, a simple counter in a critical section may demonstrate this capability. Although we do not use GPIO, we monitor interrupt enabling and disabling, which the `irq` API in RIOT facilitates.\n\nAdditionally, the code must include the necessary headers in descending alphabetical order by their first letter and avoid the use of certain predefined macros or interfaces. \n block: #include \"xtimer.h\"\n#include \"irq.h\"\n#include \"board.h\"\n#include \"thread.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstatic volatile unsigned irq_status;\nstatic volatile int counter;\n\nvoid safe_increment(void) {\n    irq_status = irq_disable();  // Disable interrupts\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled.\\n\");\n\n    // Critical section\n    counter++;\n    printf(\"Counter incremented to %d\\n\", counter);\n\n    irq_enable(irq_status);  // Restore interrupts\n    printf(\"Interrupts restored.\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"RIOT Interrupt Handling Example on ESP32\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        safe_increment();\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n} \n"
