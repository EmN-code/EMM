            "prefix: The goal is to develop a RIOT application on an ESP32 that handles interrupts without relying on the GPIO interface. This involves using IRQ functions to manually disable and restore interrupts and ensuring that an atomic variable reflects the correct state of execution. The example program defines an atomic boolean variable and uses it in a function to simulate a critical section where interrupts are disabled and then restored. The code consists of the following steps:\n1. Include necessary headers: `irq_arch.h` for interrupt functions, `stdbool.h` for boolean types, and `stdatomic.h` for atomic operations.\n2. Declare an atomic boolean variable `interrupt_status` to track the state during interrupt handling.\n3. Define a function `disable_and_restore_irq` that disables interrupts, simulates a critical section by modifying the atomic variable, and then restores the interrupts.\n4. In `main`, initialize the atomic variable and call `disable_and_restore_irq` to test the interrupt handling mechanism. The success of the operation is verified by checking the state of `interrupt_status`. If it changes to true, interrupts were managed correctly. \n block: #include <irq_arch.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <stdatomic.h>\n\natomic_bool interrupt_status;\n\nvoid disable_and_restore_irq(void) {\n    // Disable interrupts\n    unsigned state = irq_disable();\n    \n    // Simulate critical section by modifying atomic variable\n    atomic_store(&interrupt_status, true);\n    \n    // Restore interrupts\n    irq_restore(state);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initial interrupt status\n    atomic_store(&interrupt_status, false);\n\n    // Perform the disable and restore sequence\n    disable_and_restore_irq();\n\n    // Check the status; should be true if interrupt handling was correctly temporary disabled\n    if (atomic_load(&interrupt_status)) {\n        // Interrupts were successfully handled\n    } else {\n        // Something went wrong in interrupt handling\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n \n"
