            "prefix: In this program, we focus on handling interrupts using the RIOT OS on an ESP32 board. We simulate interrupt occurrences and increment a counter atomically to verify that disabling and restoring interrupts works correctly. We use the `irq` interface from RIOT to disable and enable interrupts. In this code, upon an interrupt event (simulated by calling `handle_interrupt()`), the `interrupt_counter` is safely incremented since we wrap the operation with `irq_disable()` and `irq_enable()` to prevent race conditions. The program continuously simulates interrupts and prints the number of handled interrupts every second. It does not interact with hardware GPIOs and achieves the handling via software-simulated mechanisms. \n block: #include <xtimer.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <irq.h>\n\nvolatile uint32_t interrupt_counter = 0;\n\nvoid handle_interrupt(void) {\n    irq_disable();\n    interrupt_counter++;\n    irq_enable();\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Starting the interrupt handling program on ESP32\\n\");\n    \n    while (1) {\n        // Simulating an interrupt event\n        irq_disable();\n        handle_interrupt();\n        irq_enable();\n\n        // Show the current count of handled interrupts\n        printf(\"Interrupts handled: %lu\\n\", (unsigned long)interrupt_counter);\n\n        // Wait 1 second before simulating the next interrupt.\n        xtimer_sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
