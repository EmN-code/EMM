            "prefix: This program on the ESP32 using RIOT OS demonstrates interrupt handling using the irq mechanism without the use of the GPIO interface. The goal is to verify that disabling and restoring interrupts functions as expected using atomic variables.\\n\\nFirst, we define a volatile `irq_status` to hold the state of interrupts, and a volatile integer `interrupt_counter` to keep track of how many times an interrupt has occured. We also define an `irq_handler` function which increments the counter and prints a message when an interrupt occurs.\\n\\nIn the `main` function, interrupts are first disabled using `irq_disable()` which saves the status of interrupts into `irq_status`. We simulate an interrupt by calling the `irq_handler` (though calling it here manually wouldn't have any effect if interrupts were truly disabled). After simulating, interrupts are restored using `irq_restore(irq_status)`, and then another simulated interrupt can be effectively handled and displayed. The program prints status messages to the console to keep track of these operations. \n block: #include \"irq_arch.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvolatile unsigned irq_status;\nvolatile int interrupt_counter = 0;\n\nvoid irq_handler(void) {\n    interrupt_counter++;\n    printf(\"Interrupt occurred! Counter: %d\\n\", interrupt_counter);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    irq_status = irq_disable();\n\n    printf(\"Interrupts disabled, status: %u\\n\", irq_status);\n\n    // Simulate an interrupt after disabling\n    irq_handler();  // This would be ignored in a real situation\n    \n    irq_restore(irq_status);\n    \n    printf(\"Interrupts restored.\");\n    \n    // Simulate an interrupt after restoring\n    irq_handler();  // Now it should be handled\n\n    return 0;\n} \n"
